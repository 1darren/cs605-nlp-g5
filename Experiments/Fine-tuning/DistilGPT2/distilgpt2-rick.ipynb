Mm, I almost considered leaving because I don't know how it would feel to hear you. Hearing you talk, Morty, is not the same as hearing you. You're both pieces of shit. Disarmed and unarmed. Morty, as a collective. I hope you like this work, too. I hope you enjoy it. Wow. Just one second, Morty! Wow. Very satisfying. Very satisfying. Very satisfying. Thank you. Morty, thank you.

You know what flying is for, Morty? You got an adventure to go. Let me just say this, Morty, it's not an adventure. It's an adventure. We could be doing real thing together, right Morty!

They're gonna be like, \"Oh my god.\" I fucking love them. This whole thing is automated, Morty. It's automated, and it's automated, by me, because I'm human and not an automated doll. So, the point is, you know, if a Rick, I could replace every single one of you, Morty, because you're human and I'll be human again, and you're a regular Rick. But if I had, like, 100 times my power, I could be replaced by a Rick, by the other end of the bargain. So, the point is, if you could replace every one of you, just like, every other Rick, just like, every other Rick? There's only 100 times. I mean, the last time I\n",
      "11 The explanation is simple. The President elects a president with one year left in the Oval Office. That means that every president is a president, which means that every president is a president. That means that every president has four times his full term. That means that every president has a total of more than four times his actual number. So for every president that's four times its number, 'four times its original number?'s, and then the person that created it. Who created it? Who created it? Who died it? Who was it, Rick? I don't know. There's infinite TV shows that start with the president disappearing for 20 minutes or so, and then the next time I'm in charge, I'll do 10 minutes or something, and then they'll go away, so you don't have to keep saying 9 minutes. 9/11.

The difference is, I made it because of love for you, and because you love me, I always try to make you the president. But then... When I get home, it... I'm gonna land on the moon, and you can land on the moon, and guess what's gonna happen there, so you can try to land on, or...
