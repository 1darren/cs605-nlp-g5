1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,*singing* Last King Christmas last arrived!
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"*singing* In the Christmas Christmas! *stops singing and smells the ham* Mmm... Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Um, Merry Christmas? *puts his hands on his hips* Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?"
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,Alive? For your parents?
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,Good one.
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,Hey man!
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,You ?hey man?! This holiday is about humanity.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"*not looking up from his tablet* You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,*hands over his tablet* Ohhhh...
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"Dad, I'm not giving you my phone."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"*offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend."
1,Anatomy Park,Ruben,Pearl Harbor.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,I check in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation.
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,"Aw, Dad... That is so sweet."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"*squinting suspiciously* Yeah, it is... I don't get it."
1,Anatomy Park,Ruben,Korea.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Don't worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I'll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins? proverbial paradise."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Huh. You think you know a guy.  Okay, there's my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. *opens the door* Hey hey!"
1,Anatomy Park,Leonard,"Merry Christmas, son."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Oh, hi. Can I help you?"
1,Anatomy Park,Joyce,"Jerry, this is Jacob. *takes Jacob by the arm* Didn't you get our text message?"
1,Anatomy Park,"Beth, Summer, and Morty",No.
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,You must be Jerry! That's a fine lookin? apron. William Sonoma?
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,*smiling uncomfortably* I wish... But thank you. *closes the door* So... you're a...friend of the family...?
1,Anatomy Park,Leonard,"*puts an arm around Jacob's shoulders* The way we see it, he's a part of the family."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,Wow!
1,Anatomy Park,Joyce,"After your father's brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?"
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,"Holy crap, Joyce. That's amazing."
1,Anatomy Park,Leonard,Then Jacob came into our lives. We're learning to live again.
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,All three of us.
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,...Cool... Eggnog?
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"Now we are talkin?! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Hi Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there."
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"Merry Christmas, man."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,Morty! A moment of your time?
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"He's in bad shape, Morty."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I'm sittin? here trying to save the guy's life!  I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's goin? on."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,*extremely nervous* Uh... W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,In Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty's head*
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Ruben... Minnesota?
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Ruben on the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,W-What proc?
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,"Hey Dad, where's Morty?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,He's busy.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Morty, can you hear me? Head North!"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Rick... Where am I?
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"*adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,The entrance to what?
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Welcome, Morty.  Welcome...  ...to Anatomy Park!"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"It's a little business venture I've been cookin? up on the side with Dr. Bloom.  An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"You got a problem with that last one, Morty?"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Huh? No, no, I'm just reading them out loud in the order I'm seeing them."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,Proceed to the liver.
1,Anatomy Park,Automated voice,Arriving at ?Liver?.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,*stumbles forward and hits his helmet on the window* Ow!
1,Anatomy Park,Automated voice,Mind the gap.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"It's really scary in here, Rick."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Liver's under maintenance. Ruben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"OOOOHHH! Rick, it's a monster!"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco? *belch* ?holism.  That is an animatronic werewolf."
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,Poncho! That's quite enough.
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"Morty, that's Poncho.  This is Roger and Annie."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,*staring sheepishly at Annie* Oh...
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Hey Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's goin? on here?"
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Exhibits?
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"Anatomy Park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,Watch it.
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Diseases?!
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,"Hey Doc, I have news for ya.  Your living museum is officially a wild safari!"
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,Hepatitis A! Run!
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"Oh... *leans over and wipes some food from Joyce's mouth with a napkin* The food goes in your mouth, girl!"
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Aha... I'm sorry Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a?Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?"
1,Anatomy Park,Joyce,"We can go into detail later, son."
1,Anatomy Park,Leonard,"Now wait, there, there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul.  And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Dad, please, what are you saying?"
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,"Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard. *glares at Jerry* And we support you."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover."
1,Anatomy Park,Leonard,"No no no no.  Jacob is your mother's lover.  I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman."
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,Oh... *reaches across the table and puts a hand atop theirs*
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"Jerry, this ham's got to be all you, right? It's in-cred-i-ble."
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"*smirks* Happy human holiday, Dad."
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,AHHHHHH!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system!
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,That's strange... *taps the meter* Air flow is down twenty percent.
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,So the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security is offline.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"W-Well, I guess we better check it out."
1,Anatomy Park,Alexander,"Hey, wait for me! *removes the head of his costume*"
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,*points his cane at Alexander* Put that back on!
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,"If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,*raises his hand* I'll go. *glances at Annie* Heheh...
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,"Don't be a hero, kid."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,I'm not. I'm doin? it because it's fun. *he hops from frond to frond*
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,*cocks his gun* We shouldn't be here.
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"Whatever you do, don't fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life's work."
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,Ah!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"It's alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue... *prods it with his cane, seeing something has escaped from the scar tissue* ...keeps them dormant. *looks up toward Morty, who is getting close to the catwalk* Morty! Get down!"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Whoa! *grabs hold of the catwalk as a fluid drips down onto it* Whoa!
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Oh! What are those things?!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"Tuberculosis, coming in fast!"
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,*raises gun and starts shooting at the disease* Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,*grabs Poncho's arm* No! Do you know what you've done?!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing!
1,Anatomy Park,Alexander,Waaaah! Don't let me die!
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Just take a deep breath, Ruben."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,You're not gonna die! What's your name?
1,Anatomy Park,Alexander,My name is... *his hand slips from Morty's and he's coughed up* ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Rick! Ruben's got tuberculosis!
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Oh, great work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I'll just cure it, and then?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Okay. Well I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"?and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but, I think it's great, Morty."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"*sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It's a bunch of pirates runnin? around a-a-a- pancreas. We don't whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"?please, you gotta treat yourself."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Geez, what's that horrible smell?"
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"You mean the Panda Express? *chuckles* Kidding, I-I'm kidding.  The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We're inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!"
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Everybody! Get to the colon!
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,Now I'm takin? orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Et cetera.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Hey, just so you know, I-I'm actually fourteen. So, you know..."
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,What?
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Not twelve.
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,Okay.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Because he just said I was twelve.
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,Oh. Good for you.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,*slumps forward* Nnn...
1,Anatomy Park,Animatronics,"*singing* It's a road of laughter, a trail of food. It's a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It's a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It's a small, small intestine!"
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,It goes on like this for miles...
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,*excitedly* And then we get to the large intestine!
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,Shh. *shines flashlight* I hear something.
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,*whispers* Don't move. Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move.
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,We're sitting ducks!
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Doc! Didn't you say the body was filling up with gas?
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,Yes. Why?
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,Kid! You're a genius! *pulls out a match*
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,Are you mad?!
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,*grabs Annie's hand* Everybody! In here!
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,Hey Gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation?
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"*singing* Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!"
1,Anatomy Park,Leonard,"Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha."
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,Christmas drums being played by a boy!
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,"Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad."
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,"What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here."
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,Ugh... Summer!
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"*stands up* Ethan, what are you doing here?"
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,I've been texting you for hours. What the hell?!
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday!
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,Did you even consider how that might make me feel?
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"*stands up* Summer, do you have a boyfriend?"
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,"Yeah, do you, Summer?"
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"I don't know Ethan, do I?"
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"*stands up and puts a hand on Ethan and Summer's shoulders* Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man."
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,"I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery."
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,What the hell is that?
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load."
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,"Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Poncho? What is this in your backpack?
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?"
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,Everybody get back!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?"
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,"*laughs* That's right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I'll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you! *points the knife at Dr. Bloom* You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving?"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,AHHHHH!!!
1,Anatomy Park,Poncho,Ah! Eh! Get! Get off! *he backs up and falls over the railing* Ahhhh!
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,You guys!
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,"It's gonna burst! *urges the others on* Go! Go, go, go! *pulls a lever before trying to run after the others but catches his foot in some of the machinery* My foot is stuck!"
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,No!
1,Anatomy Park,Roger,"This is okay! It's okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you could goo?"
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,No!
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"Let me ask you something Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man?"
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,From Summer being a total bitch!
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,Where's the anger coming from?
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,...My brother... took me fishing once...in the bushes... *voice begins choking up as tears fill his eyes* I can't... I can't! *covers his eyes as he starts to cry* He made me feel like a girl! *sobbing openly* I'm... m-made me a girl!
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are. *gestures to Summer* She is who she is.  Now you go to her. Brand new."
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,Come here right now!
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ethan! *they hug* I love you!"
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,I love you so much.
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,Um...
1,Anatomy Park,Joyce,"You did it again, cubby. Come here."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,No! Stop! I hate this!
1,Anatomy Park,Joyce,"Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame."
1,Anatomy Park,Animatronic Ruben,"My name's Ruben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I'll be inside all of you."
1,Anatomy Park,Animatronic Ruben,My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ?90s.
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,*whispering to Morty* You can put your fingers wherever you want?
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,I'm trying to concentrate.
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Ah, Rick?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"*holds up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry."
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"*enters anyway* I wanted to say I'm sorry I ever judged you. *leans on the ping pong table, looking down at Ruben's corpse* Right now, you're my sanest relative."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Relative? That's it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Morty, I'm talkin? about Ruben's left nipple!"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,We need to get to the left nipple!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"The body is decaying!  The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the Bone Train. *to Annie* Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?"
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,If it'll get us out of here.
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?"
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die. Let's go.
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Well, I can see that you're busy... Merry Christmas, Rick."
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"...Uh, well..."
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"No, you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on."
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,*points* What the hell is that?
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,E. coli outbreak. Hurry!
1,Anatomy Park,Dr. Bloom,"Oh wait, there is an autopilot.  WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!"
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,They're chewing through the doors!
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Euuuugh! *grabs a fire extinguisher and beats the E. coli off the train with it* We're in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we're also in a really bad situation!"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"I'm almost there, Morty!"
1,Anatomy Park,Reporter,Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?
1,Anatomy Park,Tom,"Well, his eyes aren't twinkling, and his dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!"
1,Anatomy Park,Reporter,"Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles."
1,Anatomy Park,Eric,"We've got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size! And you know what they say about that!"
1,Anatomy Park,Reporter,"Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Oh my god, the track!"
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,It's Hepatitis A!
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,The nipple hole...
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,It's beautiful...
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,Aw no!
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Um... We... Did we have some sort of relationship with him?
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,I... think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys.
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Oh. Huh.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,Where's Dr. Bloom?
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,Sorry Rick... He's dead...
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!"
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together."
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,"I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will?"
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,It's raining blood!
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,"Oh, shit. find Jerry!"
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,Oh god.
1,Anatomy Park,Beth,Jerry!
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,*stands and hugs her* It's alright! The TV says there's nothing to worry about.
1,Anatomy Park,Reporter,The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine.
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"Dad, can I have my phone back?"
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax."
1,Anatomy Park,Jacob,This is nice.
1,Anatomy Park,Jerry,"Yeah. *puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob."
1,Anatomy Park,Summer,"No we didn't, Dad. No we didn't."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Too bad about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park."
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,"Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,What about Pirates of the Pancreas...?
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,Booyah! Hold your breath!
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,"Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin? going there, Rick!"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina."
1,Anatomy Park,Morty,W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno!
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"C'mon. Let's get some stuffing, I'm starving."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin? around with their faces stuffed in computer screens.  Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?"
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,"Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Loud and clear, Annie."
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,"Great! We're also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian?"
1,Anatomy Park,Alejandro,Hey Rick.
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,"Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media."
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,Hey everybody.
1,Anatomy Park,All,"Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin?."
1,Anatomy Park,Annie,So. Pirates of the Pancreas.
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Yeah, talk to me."
1,Anatomy Park,Alejandro,"Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, ?Okay, what does a pancreas do??  And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we're starting with a new?"
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,"So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?"
1,Anatomy Park,Rick,"Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan."
1,Anatomy Park,Ethan,... Cool. And who pays me?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,"So dad, guess what tomorrow is..."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,"No... well, it might be..."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,It is.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,"Fine, but also, tomorrow is your one year anniversary back in our lives. I'm gonna make you flying saucer-shaped pancakes."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,"Happy anniversary, dad!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.  Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,Should be making us a whole restaurant.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,"Nonsense, we couldn't be happier to have you around. I just wish I got to see more of you."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-137. You are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,Hey! What the heck?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,Neutralise the Jerry.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Wait, no! I'll-"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Summer,Dad!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,Dad!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Rick
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Everybody relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let's get it over with."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,Bring his Mo--orty.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Oh, man."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Leave my  Morty out of this!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join  the council.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,"Wait, wh-wh-wh-what about Jerry?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"-give you anything! I have a rare antique coin collection, just don't hurt me!  Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2D2s instead of George Washingtons."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,Our son's been abducted!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,You hate me for buying those coins!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Geez, Rick! Wh-what is this place?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,The Citadel of Ricks. It's the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Council of Ricks?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"As you know, Morty, I've got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. Galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government: wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on Yahoo! Answers."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Hey, what do you know? It's a cowboy version of me!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Geez, you're easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who's-who of who's you and me."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Salesman 1,"Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement, with some Morty dazzlers!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Salesman 2,"Hey, check this out!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty Doll,Show me the Morty!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Dumb.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Salseman 3,"scuse me, sir. Is your Morty insured? You know, every year hundreds of Mortys are injured in-"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,I say the point of being a Rick is being a-Rick.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Hey, save your Rick rules for the  sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"Fuck me, pal."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Fuck you?! No no no no no, fuck me!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,Bring up the holograms!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,"Twenty-seven Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines. An unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, Earth Rick C-137?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,You  have a history of non-cooperation with the council.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick! Wh-wh-wh-why isn't he here in handcuffs?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,Because he's dead too!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick crowd,No!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,"Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile! Of all the Ricks in the Central Finite Curve, you're the Malcontent! The rogue."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,I'm the Rick! And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence! So as they say in Canada, peace oot!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,Evidence? Good idea. Scan his Portal Gun!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Oh, come on. Don't look at another man's Portal Gun history. We-we all go to weird places."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,"Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,What? That's Rick-diculous. I'm obviously being set up!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick Council 1,"Earth Rick C-137! The Council of Ricks sentences you to The Machine of Unspeakable Doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp! Also, every ten seconds it stabs your balls."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,I've heard enough.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Run, Morty!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Crowd rick,"Uh uh, not you!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Aaaaah!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Armed Rick 1,Nooo!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Armed Rick 2,Arrrrgh! Ahhhh!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Armed Rick 3,Aaaah!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Armed Ricks 4 and 5,Oof!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Oh! Oooh!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Pizza 1,"Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people please."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Pizza 2,"White people. No no no no no, black people. And hispanic on half."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Phone 1,"Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Phone 2,"High chair. No no no no no, recliner! And wheelchair on half."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Armed Rick 6,They could have gone into any one of these.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Sofa 1,"Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones please."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Sofa 2,"Cellphone. No no no no no, rotary! And payphone on half."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,That'll keep 'em  busy for a while.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Those guys were wrong, right? You don't- you wouldn't kill yourself? y-yourselves?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"?Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,By finding the real Rick killer.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"I'm scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"Alright, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is going to trace his location. You just gotta keep 'em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,Who wants lemonade?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"Oh yeah! Mmm! Oh, delicious!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 2,"Beth,  you're a treasure."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 3,"I have a Beth just like you in my  reality, except you know what? She's not as brilliant or  attractive!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,"Aww, thank  you!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,All Ricks,Ohohoho! She did it! She did it!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Uh, hello?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Hey Jerry, it's Rick."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Rick! Heyy. Haha, what's- what's up?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"So listen, the heat's on and  there's nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,What?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Is that cool with you, dog?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Rick, no! Mortyyyy!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 4,I got it! The call's coming from? inside the house!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won't be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they'll be on to us.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Chair waiter,"Phones ?? la clams, and phonesgetti with phoneballs. Anything else?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, more phonesticks please."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Phone waiter,"Right away, sir."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ?gee, that kinda devalues our bond.? But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, it's gotta be that way. You're a camouflage."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh,  Morty waves."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Um? because? our personalities are so different?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let's go!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Uh-oh!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"scuse me, we've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion I'm going to mark us each with a red X right now. That way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 2,"Hey, check it out!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,Dammit!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Chair waiter,Hey! You didn't pay your bill!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,The red X! Red X.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don't have to keep saying it over and over and over."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn't that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Oh my god, Rick, look! There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Not people, Morty. Mortys."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Oh my god? wh-why would somebody do this? It's horrible!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put 'em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, motherfucker. I fiddled with a  concept like this once."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn't do this, it's barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable.  Which I also wouldn't do! I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Beth,Coffee time!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,Ugh.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,Hi Jerry!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Leave me alone, I'm working!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Oh, you are? Wh-wh-what do you do?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,Ugh. I'm- I'm in between advertising jobs.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"W-well, it's a little more complicated than that?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy that really has it all together!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Dude, are you? wh- you're being a dick, right?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Oh gosh, wh- I hope not! I-I-I-I wouldn't want to offend you in any way!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,You're really a Rick?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,Ohoho! Y-of course I am! Just as much as my Morty's a Morty!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie 'mask.? You know, the one with Cher in it?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"That's right, Jerry! He-he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz mask people! He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty! They assigned him to me because? I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I'd love 'em  if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"Hey, get a load of this! Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 2,"Haha, this is perfect."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,I'm not doofus Rick! I'm Rick J-19-Zeta-7!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,Hey! I don't eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry? I'm the worst Rick of them all."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"According to who? Other versions of you? If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Wow, you really are wise, Jerry. I-I guess that's why you work in advertising!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,You don't care about me at all! I'm no different than that jacket you've got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I'm just a tool! I-I'm just an object!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"You know what Rick, I'll tell you something! I'm more than a human shield!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, that's right! You are! You're a perfect impenetrable suit of human armour, Morty! Because you're as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say 'shut up? it's really good advice."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Great, nice work, Morty."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Urrgh.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Ooh, look at you, C-137! You're- aren't you a tough customer?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Not in this dimension it isn't. In fact, hah, I invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Well lah-dee-dah.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Hey, that's mine!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"I'm not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you're a monster."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Don't be Rickdiculous, Morty."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,W-will you stop saying that? It's stupid.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,Take his Morty away.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Morty,Come with me.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can? shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Morty,It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Morty,In here.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Ahh, isn't it beautiful?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Lobster alien,Hehehehehehehehehe.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,That guy got it.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Ah-ah Rick, quiet. You're missing my symphony."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Hey, I'll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Lobster alien,Hehehehehehehehehe.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,This guy is on it!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That's just a random noise it makes every ten seconds."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Lobster alien,Hehehehehehehehehe.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Awww.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"See, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We're not so  different, you and I."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, duh!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers, I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed 'em out from most evil to least evil. Here's where I am. And look at right here's where you are, Rick. This guy right here? Super weird."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you're going with this? ?Cause that's where I'd be going."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Please. I think I'm doing pretty good on my own. I'm simply going to download the contents of your brain, and then kill you."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate, and just a tad of chlorified tartrate: ovenless brownies!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,It's incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Well, come on, I can't take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. C'mere Jerry!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Hey, uh. C'mere, uh. I-I wanna show you something."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Okay, look. Everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but? you're a genius scientist, what do you think? There's little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"You know Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value. The truth is? you bought 'em ?cause you like 'em. They have value to you. That's what matters."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,How long are you staying?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,Until we find your Rick.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,I found mine. I found mine.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Help!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Religious Morty,"There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,So what? Y-y-y-y-you're just going to give up?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Religious Morty,We're giving in to the power of the One True Morty. One day he will return!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,All religious Mortys,Praise the One True Morty!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Alright Mortys, listen up! My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137! I know you're scared, because I'm scared! But that's no reason to accept our fate. We're Mortys! We're not defined by our relationships to Rick. Our destiny is our own!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty 1,This sounds like something the One True Morty might say. I'm sick of being a human shield! I-I-I-I wanna be a gardener!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty 2,"I wanna write really crazy, intense action novels."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Hammer Morty,I'm more than just a hammer!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Religious Morty,He is the one true Morty! The one true Morty!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,All Mortys,Hooray!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Lobster alien,"Hey, keep it down!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,All Mortys,Raaaaugh!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"You've lived quite a life, Rick. It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,You're crying? Over a Morty?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"No, I'm just allergic to dipshits."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Ugh, pathetic. We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Evil Rick,"Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,You're lucky I'm not a Rick.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Point taken, but this is  no time for arcs."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"Yeah, hello?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,Huh? Wh-who is this?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"I found the real killer, biitch! Get over here!"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,Yo ding-dong! We're done here. Time to go.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Well Jerry, I  guess this means goodbye."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"W-w-well, does it have to? Heh, you, you look just like Rick. We could maybe? you know? get rid of him? I'm not saying kill him, necessarily, I-I'm also not saying necessarily not kill him, but-"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Jerry. W-we both know it wouldn't work. It's time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love ya."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Wh-wh-what's gonna happen to all these Mortys?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Council Rick 1,"They'll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls? poor little Rickless bastards."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Council Rick 1,"Earth Rick C-137, the Council apologises for its false accusation. And in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty, in the event that  your current  Morty should-"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let's hit it."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Alright, Morty, don't break an arm jerking yourself off."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Man, I can't believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don't connect because I'm the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would  go without saying that the Rickest Rick? would have the Mortyest Morty."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"It would go without saying, huh?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,Na  The Mortyest Morty?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Morty,"Oh yeah, how's that?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,I-I-I'll explain when you're older.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,What a mess!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 2,Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,What is that?
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 2,Hand me the laser defibrillator.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Doofus Rick,"Hey guys! Uh, c-can I help?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 2,No! Go clean the toilets! Maybe you'll make friends with some turds.
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,You make us ashamed to be ourselves!
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 1,"My God! I've seen this technology before. This Rick was being controlled remotely, puppeteered by somebody else! This is the Receiver."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick 2,"Yeah, but where's the Transmitter?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?"
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Jerry,"Nothing! I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"Alright. Okay, get out."
1,Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind,Rick,"What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I've got like  ten Ricks to call right now!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Wh? convincing?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Uhhokay.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Beth,"*robotic* I'm going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,What's with Mom?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph?*burp*?isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Whatever, quote-unquote 'morty.?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Alright, well I'll see you after school.  Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is?  Morty?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Uh, me?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,What is 5 x 9?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jessica,"Whoo! Way to go, Morty!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,*spying from outside* Interesting?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Student,"Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, that's a good question."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Concentrated huh?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Uhhh?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jessica,"Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jessica,"I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I'll be your girlfriend."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Uh, y-you will?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"*kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an F!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,He doesn't care.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Aw, man!  Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Take a shower with me, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,What?!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"It's all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of? crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone's just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"I can't let you do that, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Give it to me!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,No! You give it to me!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,G-g-give it!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Morty, come on! Morty!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"No, Rick!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Zigerion 1,"Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Zigerion 1,"I think we should make Kevin look, sir."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Kevin,What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Stu,"Uh, sir, we have a situation over here."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Stu,"Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder.  There's another real human in the simulator."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Zigerion 2,"Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Zigerion 3,Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Kevin,"Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There's still another human in here! Who is he?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Stu,"Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"*sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,*inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Radio,"This is earth radio. And now, here's?human music."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Rick!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"I don't know, Rick. I mean, I've seen people do that before."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Okay, okay, you got me on that one."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Paramedic,"We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,National Apple Farmers of America?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith.  Alright. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry.  With that, I give you your new slogan!  Well, say something! Do you like it?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,You do?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,All,Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,So I sold it? I sold the idea?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,All,Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Oh my god! Thank you!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,All,*shaking each others? hands* Thank you. You're welcome.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Hey! I just sold my first pitch!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Old man,Slow down!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Woman,Lookin' good.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mailman,My man!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Simulation Beth,*answers phone* Hello.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Guess who just sold the apples campaign.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Simulation Beth,Who just sold the apples campaign?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?" after all. Guess someone was wrong.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Simulation Beth,Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I've got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I'm coming home to share it with my beautiful wife."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Simulation Beth,Okay.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Wait, really?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Simulation Beth,Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Woman,Lookin' good.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Old man,Slow down!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mailman,My man! *glitches into a tree*
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine.  Just follow my lead.  Yo, deejay, drop that beat."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, ""The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter,"" for a crowd this tiny."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"You got that right, Rick."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Now that's more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say ""hey-oh!"" yeah!  All the ladies say, ""yeah!""  Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"*kisses Beth, who is still in front of the phone* Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don't move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an ""L"" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!  Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's? it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to'the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Holy crap!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Come on, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,*jumps off edge*
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Zigerion,"Sir, they're over the edge."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"Yes, they are. Just as planned. *evil laughter, others join in* Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"I've got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball.  Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Totes malotes, dawg."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Just kind of hard to believe, you know?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Look, I'm a fraud. I mean, let's face it. ""Hungry for apples"" is just a rip-off of ""Got milk?"" It's almost identical."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,*crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You? There's not even a single word in "Hungry for Apples" that's shared by "Got milk?" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Yeah! Wait. Really?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"I-I'm not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Could we nominate me?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,*snaps fingers* Yes.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Holy crap!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.  Huh. I thought I entered the code right."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"Well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation?inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Cynthia,"Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,Uhh?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,That is why you're never getting home. Get them!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,RUN MORTY!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Oh my god!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um? Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mailman,My man!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mailmen,My my my my man!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Aah! What the hell?!  No.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,Jerry?!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Dad!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them*
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,*sobbing* No!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Whoa! It's all here, Rick!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,*freezes up*
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Oh, no."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,What the??
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,No!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"*laughing* Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation of a simulation?inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Zigerion 1,Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Kevin,"You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Zigerion 1,I don't know. Can you?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You're not. *walks back* Or are you?  *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Cynthia,"Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"*loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,"You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Prince Nebulon,"All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks? One part cesium?. A-and listen, I'm sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn't ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. *readies water bottle* And the final ingredient?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,So? What do you think?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,You're fired.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Jerry,Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,"Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Mr. Marklevitz,"Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Hey, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,What?
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Oh, boy."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"Have you been drinking, Rick?"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"I really appreciate you, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"*suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty's throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,No! No! No!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,You little son of a bitch!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,"*terrified, gasps*"
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,"I-I-I'm sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good? You're a good kid, Morty."
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Geez!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,Y-you're a good? You're a good kid. *passes out*
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,Oh my god!
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Rick,*snores*
1,M. Night Shaym-Aliens!,Morty,W-w-what the hell? What a life.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,Run!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,"Jerry, Beth, and Summer",*incoherent zombie noises*
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Morty, do it! Hit the button now!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"I can't do it, Rick! They're my parents and sister!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"*holding off the clones* Morty, I already told you, it's not your family! They're clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Morty, please. I love you, sweetheart."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Ohhhh?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Good work, Morty."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"*holding up the device and smiling* Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,I just killed my family! I don't care what they were!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Y-You know what, Rick? That's it! I-I'm done with these?insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I'm out!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Whoa whoa whoa, *grabs Morty's shoulder, stopping him* come on, Morty! D-D-Don't be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,*pushes Rick's hands away* You're the one that's crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that's real easy to say from the sidekick position. But?But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,*suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You'll let me call the shots?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Okay, fine. But let's make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,Every 10th.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,Washing dishes?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,No. The opposite. Can you fix it?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Summer,"Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,Yeah just don't do it.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Summer,Grandpa!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Yes, siree!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,The Meeseeks fulfills the request.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,All done!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Wow!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,And then it stops existing.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Summer,"Oh, my God, he exploded!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,So many possibilities.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Summer,My mind is racing.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Summer,I want to be popular at school!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Ooh, okay!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Summer, what did I just-"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 2,"Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,I want I want to be a more complete woman!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Beth!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 2,"Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,You guys are doing it wrong. He said "simple."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"Ooh, yeah! Can do!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Nailed it.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,Can't wait.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Oh, my God, so embarrassing."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Villager,"At last! Two heroes! You must help us! This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,Yeah. Beginner's luck.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 1,"In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Principal Gene V.,"Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- - No, I'll get your info from Summer."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...-- I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 2,"She's still there, Beth."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Well, her waistline isn't."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 2,"Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,You're saying I should leave Jerry.  I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Waiter,More wine?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,I think I've had enough.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Yeah, yeah. I got it."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"No, Jerry, I'm the one who SUCKS! Let me try something."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 4,I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 4,Hi!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 4,Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"Ooh, he's trying!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Giant,Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Giant,I smell the blood of- whoop!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Holy crap.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Giant woman,"Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Detective,"Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, ""hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"""
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Th-th but that's not how it went down!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Detective,"Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Summer,"Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,The most important love you can receive is from yourself.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,Just try to relax.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox!  Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,You're kidding me.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,Notice anything different?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,I'm sorry. Hours?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Summer,"Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Judge,"Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"We're gonna be okay, Rick."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Giant Lawyer,"Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,W-what the hell is he talking about?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Giant Lawyer,"They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Oh, boy, Morty."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"What do you say, Morty?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"I say give me a hand, sidekick."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,NOTE,to make this easier an * will be put next to meeseeks every time a different meeseeks talks.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Everybody shut up! Let me try!  Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,I'm going out.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Wait. What?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I'll take you to dinner."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,All the Meeseeks,AWWWWWWW!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,'Cause he roped me into this!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,"Well, him over there, he roped me into this!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,"Well, he roped me into this!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,"Well, what about me? He roped me into this."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,"Well, that one over there roped me into this."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,"Well, he roped me into this."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.  Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"What are you looking at, motherfucker?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Easy, Rick."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Waitress,"Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Slippery,Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Waitress,That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Booby Buyer,"Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Waitess,"It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Booby Buyer,Rats! What a shame.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Uh, because it's lame?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,Whatever.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks 3,"Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,New Meeseeks,I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,Kill him!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,New Meeseeks,Hisssss!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Jelly Bean,How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Jelly Bean,Nice. Is it a fun adventure?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Jelly Bean,"Well, isn't that what adventures do?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Jelly Bean,Yeah.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Okay. Uh. B-bye.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Jelly Bean,"Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Jelly Bean,Stop fighting me! Just let this happen!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Get off of me!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,? Sweet home Alabama. Wooooo! ?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Whoo! No! Stop! Please!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Mr. Jelly Bean,"Stop being such a fucking tease, you sweet little twat!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,No! No!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks *,The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,All other Meeseeks,Where's he going with this? What does he mean?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,When we kill him!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Where would you go?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,What the heck?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,There he is!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Run, Jerry!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Come on out, Jerry!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,"Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Oh, we're well past that, Jerry."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Card Player,"Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Read 'em and weep, fellas!  Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay?  Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Please, I just want to... go h-home."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,Really?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Slippery,Buckle up!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask...  ...what's your name, ma'am?"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Woman,"Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"I'm counting to three, Jerry."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,All Meeseeks,Ooooohhh!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Samantha,What the fuck is going on?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,All Meeseeks,He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Samantha,"Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Meeseeks,"Ooh, nice!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,I think we'll take our food to go.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Owner,"No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Fair enough.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,The First Villager,"Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes!"
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,The First Villager,"Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Morty,"Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,So... You still thinking about taking that trip?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to ""complete their task."""
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Was I one of those guys?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,Well... I got you pregnant.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,Yeah...
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,What the hell happened to this place?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,"Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Jerry,No. No more boxes.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Rick,"What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dub!  Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Beth,I don't get it.
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Villager 1,"Sir, I think you're going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king Jelly Bean's closet.  We have to tell the people."
1,Meeseeks and Destroy,Villager 2,Wait. Destroy it.  Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Alien,"That is multiphase quantum resonator,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Well, does it defraculate?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Alien,Fuck no.
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Then -- then -- then it's a broken defraculator,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Alien,"Like you would even know dick about fraculation! Your planet just got cellphones, and the coverage still sucks!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur, So, let's say 60 smidgens, I tell you what -- I'll do you a favor, I'll throw in a fart,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Hey, uh, Rick, um, you think maybe I could get something from this place, like a souvenir, like, just to have ---like, something cool, you know?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Not here, Morty, We'll stop somewhere else, because, you know, there's always another pawn shop,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, okay,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Oh, it looks cool, huh?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Yeah! You know, I mean, it's different from the stuff on earth, and, you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy, and, you know,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Okay, 60 for the resonator, and my grandson wants the sex robot."
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"So, we're just going to pretend this isn't happening?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"I don't know,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,Whew!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Well, I'm intervening."
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,Intervening with puberty?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Jesus, Did I really set the bar that low?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Um, Rick, could you come with me, please -- q-quickly?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Okay, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,That is Gwendolyn --
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Strange -- that's usually the man's job,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Okay, unacceptable!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,What is going on?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"All right, Uh-oh,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"""Uh-oh""? What is that?!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Hmm, I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Grandpa Rick, no, no!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Dad, What do you think you're doing?!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Hey, listen -- you guys quarantined the house when Summer brought olives back from Mexico,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"I lost the chance to be careful, Rick,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Don't name it,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,",,,Morty Jr ,?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Oh, crap he named it."
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Well, dad, it's a living thing, and it's half human,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Fine, I'm gonna take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Yeah, Good one, Jerry,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Ohh,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"They always do,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Hey, uh, 1995 called!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Why, Jerry?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Well, I can't solve the problem my way, thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Oh, right -- because there's something about having a wiener that would make me better at walking through a hole?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Oh, crap,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,Grandpa Rick! Ugh!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs."
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"You're doing great Morty,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Then you put it down and let it cry itself out,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Yeah, right,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Stop filling it with your own insecurity,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,What the -- aah! Aah!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Listen to me,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Knock it off, both of you!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,At least we can agree on that.
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Thanks, dum-dum,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"That burka is a human-rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Look, I'm trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts, and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from carting you off,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Ugh, What's the deal with this place?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,You think it's efficient to get rid of women?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,You ever see a line for the men's room?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,All,Droppin' loads!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"The plot thickens,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Yeah, like it was my dream to watch,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,Aaaah!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Grandpa Rick, where are we going?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Oh, there -- there we go, Summer,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian,Silence!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian,"Your slave is ill-mannered,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,My slave?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian,"We assume you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"He's my slave,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, Morty Jr,! you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"Da,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"What was that,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,Death!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"""Dada,"""
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,Damnation!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Um,,,""Dada""?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"Destruction, Domination,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian PA System,"The spider in sector ""C"" is still alive,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Mar-sha,"I am Mar-sha, ruler of Gazorpazorp,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,What is this place?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Mar-sha,Paradise.
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"I am here if you need to talk,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Mar-sha,"From here, we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"That was just a baby,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Wait a minute, We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"You speak when you're spoken to, ding-a-ling!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,How did you know?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"You are insulting them,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"I don't care, Summer!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Well, it really doesn't matter what you want, because this is a sane place where women rule,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Yeah, You know what I have to say about that?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,Grandpa!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"It's not dominated by us, okay?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,Equals?! We make 70% of your salary for the same job!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,Whoa!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"This is for you, daddy,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, man! Um, okay, listen to me, Morty Jr, i've got to tell you something very important, okay? killing is bad, bad!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"You're silly, daddy,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"No, Morty Jr, I'm being serious, okay? you need to put your energy into something else, I mean, what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"I'd like to dance, on the graves of my enemies"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Ohh! No, Morty Jr,!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"Daddy, can I go outside?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,No! Absolutely not!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"But that's where all the people and the animals are,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Yeah, but you can't go out there because the air is poisonous for you, you will die, you'll die instantly if you ever leave this house, you hear me?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,For real?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"For real times a million, buddy, So, let's just stay inside, and, you know, let's try dancing, right?Look at me, Yay! Look, We're gonna dance, Come on, Join dance with me here, We love to dance."
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,Why do we love to dance?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,Because I said so!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"Nice,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Nice,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,Because I got --
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian #2,"The worst crime a female can commit,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,Pfft!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"What, what, what -- a night on the couch?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Ooh, gerp,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,I hate you so much right now.
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian #2,"This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness, so we are forced to improvise,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian #2,No! Stop interrupting!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"What? Just give me a gun,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian #2,Stop interrupting!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Look, I'm sorry, Summer,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Top, My top!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Gazorpian #2,"It says, ""Marc Jacobs,"""
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Yes,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"Okay, ouch, Noted,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Good job, Summer, and thanks, girls,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,Morty Jr! Smoking?! that is not okay!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,What are you gonna do? ground me? I can't go outside anyway!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"So what?! you could do things inside! you could play guitar, you could masturbate."
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"I don't wanna masturbate, i want to conquer the planet!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, here we go again! you know, who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet, Morty Jr,?!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"Love, that's all you care about! what about weapons?! what about domination of the enemy?!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"All right, that's it -- no more History Channel! this TV is for cartoons and video games only!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,I hate video games!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"You take that back! give it to me!  Ugh! I-I-I didn't mean -- I didn't mean that, I didn't mean to do that, I'm sorry,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,I can't take this anymore! i'd rather breathe poison than live another minute with you!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"No! No, no, no! Stop!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"' My life has been a lie, God is dead, The government's lame, Thanksgiving is about killing Indians, Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, They moved the date, it was a pagan holiday!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, dad!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, my god!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Dad, there he is!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"Oh, god,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, my god!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Morty Jr,, no!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,My car!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,? And that's how we play handy hands! ?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Out of the -- out of the way, Morty!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,No!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creatures in the universe!"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,He's my son!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"I know, Morty Jr,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,I'm an alien?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,But I want to murder everyone I see!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Well, you know,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Brad Anderson,"Actually, there is,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Oh, Wow,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Huh,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Brad Anderson,"Well, did you get the impression"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,Tell me that wasn't
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"Aw, see?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,Maybe!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,"I know you can do it, son,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,I think it's time I get a place of my own.
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,Aaaaaaah!
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Jerry,"So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear axle?"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Isn't it interesting,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventures?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"No, I'd say, given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time and any epiphanies about gender politics were a projection of your feminine insecurity,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,Dad? Summer?
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Summer,"On Gazorpazorp,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"I was reading a newspaper,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Rick,"Oh, that's interesting,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Interviewer,"Mortimer smith, Jr,,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty Jr,"Certainly,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Interviewer,"But you persevered, and created this masterpiece from your suffering."
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Beth,"It's a thankless job,"
1,Raising Gazorpazorp,Morty,I hope he's eating enough.
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Bye, mom! Bye, dad!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Drive carefully!
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Have fun, you two."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our...  Titanic-themed getaway."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I  have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth and Jerry in unison,That's right.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Wait... What?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song ""blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"". You guys know that song?  From Tiny Roger's? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s?"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"No-nobody?  A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Not one thing out of place.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Not a single thing.
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,I found Jello.
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room.  Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said?"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Uh, Summer, you can't have a party."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Ugh.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Because  I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,What do you mean you're having a party?  Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"""Glip glop?"" You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Is that like their n-word?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and --"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Why do you party?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"To get  wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes."
1,Ricksy Business,Tour Guide,"After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?
1,Ricksy Business,Tour Guide,"I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow!"
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit?
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Well, it's not the ""king of the world"" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio.  This is where rose says, ""I'm flying, Jack!"" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Well, what about her?"
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line?"
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"I, uh -- I could get into trouble."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,We won't tell.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,So... You're a Titanic fanatic?
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Happy to help... rose.
1,Ricksy Business,Tammy,"I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it..."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Brad! Hey!
1,Ricksy Business,Brad,Yo.
1,Ricksy Business,Tammy,"Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk."
1,Ricksy Business,Brad,Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool.
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Ugh! Grandpa!
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Birdperson!
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,I am pleased there is no emergency.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Oh, there's an emergency, all right.  A pussy emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?"
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah.  Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Uh... people? Mm, six."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Yo! What up, my glip glops?!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, man!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Hey, uh, what the hell?!"
1,Ricksy Business,Jelly-like creature with items stuck inside of it,Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed!"
1,Ricksy Business,Blue alien,Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!"
1,Ricksy Business,Gearhead,The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Rick, you got to stop --"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Morty! Have you met Gearhead?
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Hey, how's it --"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars."
1,Ricksy Business,Gearhead,"How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Uh... Not at all.
1,Ricksy Business,Gearhead,"Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago..."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Have a little perspective.
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,"Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Aw! Squanchy!
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg!"
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,All right! I like your squanch!
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Uh, Rick, what exactly is ""squanching""?"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Jessica.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Knock it off, Slow Mobius!"
1,Ricksy Business,Slow Mobius,"Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,I can't believe she's here.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Oh, Rose."
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,Whee!
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Is that what I think it is?
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie."
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,It's so romantic.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,I can't wait to do that with Beth.
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Look!
1,Ricksy Business,Voice through speaker,"Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed."
1,Ricksy Business,Voice through speaker,"Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed."
1,Ricksy Business,Captain #1,"Uh, sir? There's not a problem."
1,Ricksy Business,Captain #2,What do you mean there's not a problem?
1,Ricksy Business,Captain #1,The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!
1,Ricksy Business,Captain #2,"Well, do something! Steer into it!"
1,Ricksy Business,Captain #1,I'm trying!
1,Ricksy Business,Captain #2,It's too late.  Ladies and gentlemen... Don't brace yourselves.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,No! What happened?!
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,Their rail system must have failed.
1,Ricksy Business,Passengers,"Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! What are we gonna do?!"
1,Ricksy Business,Guy,Totally gonna get laid tonight.
1,Ricksy Business,Tammy,I like your feathers.
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,They are designed to attract the attention of the female.
1,Ricksy Business,Tammy,It's working.
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,"Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate."
1,Ricksy Business,Tammy,I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for...
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,I believe birdperson can arrange that.
1,Ricksy Business,Nancy,"Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while."
1,Ricksy Business,Girl,"Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party.  Everybody should be welcome."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,I thought everyone was welcome.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out  it just adds up to a lame, weird loser."
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being."
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body!
1,Ricksy Business,Brad,"Whoa. What's up, man?"
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"I have no quarrel with you, boy."
1,Ricksy Business,Brad,"""Boy""? What's that supposed to mean?"
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but..."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Don't look at me, dude."
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so --"
1,Ricksy Business,Brad,So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"Well, no, but... You know?"
1,Ricksy Business,Brad,What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?
1,Ricksy Business,Jessica,"Leave him alone, Brad."
1,Ricksy Business,Brad,"Stay out of this, Jessica!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Kick his ass, Brad!"
1,Ricksy Business,Everyone except Morty and Jessica,Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass!
1,Ricksy Business,Jessica,Brad!
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Rick!
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"I just did you a favor, Morty."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.
1,Ricksy Business,Jessica,Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Jessica, can I show you something?"
1,Ricksy Business,Jessica,Wow! Look at all this stuff.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.
1,Ricksy Business,Jessica,It's beautiful.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you."
1,Ricksy Business,Jesica,"What's that, Morty?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,I think that you're the most --
1,Ricksy Business,Jessica,"No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there."
1,Ricksy Business,Jessica,Aah!
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, my God!"
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,"Hey, I'm squanching in here!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Huh. Big star in the sky.  Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters.  We'll be fine! Let's party!
1,Ricksy Business,Stereo,"? Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ?"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax!  It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals.  Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Okay. Let's go, then."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Yeah. Me too. I should stay.
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,You guys have any aspirin?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you."
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Shut up, Lincoler.  It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too."
1,Ricksy Business,Nancy,What? Why -- why me?
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute."
1,Ricksy Business,Captain #2,"Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,But -- but --
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"You see, Jerry?  May I show you something?"
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a "Titanic" failure.  Get it?
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Ooh!
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"Draw me, Jerry."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind."
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh."
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,You are gonna draw me.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Aah!
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there.
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close."
1,Ricksy Business,Nancy,There they are!
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,Wait. Something's not right.
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes!
1,Ricksy Business,Nancy,Summer's gonna like me again.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!"
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"Mein journey is over, Morty.  I have something important to tell you."
1,Ricksy Business,Gearhead,"? And the gears, they turned for a thousand years ? ? until the dark day that they stopped ?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Rick, I got them! I got the crystals!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"All right! You did it, Morty."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes.  He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals.  And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Wait a minute. What?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,? Put your right foot forward ? ? and your left foot back ? ? then fucking slide around ? ? like on a nordictrack ?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"? move to the left ? ? step to the right ? ? wiggle your elbows, and look ? ? up into the light ?"
1,Ricksy Business,Song,"? it's the, it's the ? ? it's the Rick dance ? ? it's the, it's the ? ? it's the Rick dance ?"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!"
1,Ricksy Business,Song,"? It's the, it's the ? ? it's the Rick dance ?"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"That's the Rick dance! All right!  Whoa, man!"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty.  Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Uh, squanchy?"
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,Don't squaunch at me.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!"
1,Ricksy Business,Tammy,"Boo! You suck, whatever your name is."
1,Ricksy Business,Everyone,Boo!
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Morty, you're the worst, Morty."
1,Ricksy Business,Gearhead,But these gears just started turnin'.
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"Almost finished, Jerry?"
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes."
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,I'm sure it's good enough. Move!
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,"Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier.  But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me."
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,No mess. No clean.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Beth!
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips?"
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,What?
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Well, at least you got all this free stuff."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"Ugh! I'm not going to fit.  Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and --"
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,"Jerry, just leave the door."
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,"It's not a door, Beth. It's debris."
1,Ricksy Business,Beth,I don't care. Just leave it.
1,Ricksy Business,Jerry,Yeah. Okay.
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,Ahahahah! "Cape fear"! Hahahaha! "Cape fear"! I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from "cape fear".
1,Ricksy Business,Lucy,Ugh! Auh! Augh!
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,"Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place!"
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Cool. I'm coming, too."
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,"Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,What?
1,Ricksy Business,Squanchy,Nancy told us what a bitch you are.
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Guys, seriously. Nancy?"
1,Ricksy Business,Nancy,"Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked.  You're so wise."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm..."
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,May I assist you with that?
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Uh, sure, yeah.  Thanks."
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,"Morty, do you know what ""wubba lubba dub dub"" means?"
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase."
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,"It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, ""I am in great pain. Please help me."""
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically."
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,"No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Come on, um..."
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,Birdperson.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole."
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,"My people have another saying-- ""gubba nub nub doo rah kah"". It means, ""whatever lets you sleep at night""."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,"Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner."
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,"This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!"
1,Ricksy Business,Birdperson,Caw!
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Wow. We are so screwed.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Rick, wake up."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Augh. Uh, all -- all right.  All right. Hold -- hold on.  Ahh! So good."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Bring me the thing.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,What -- what thing?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It -- it -- it beeps."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Rick! That describes everything in your garage!
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Do you mean this?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Summer  for for the win.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"All right, that should do it."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,Whoa! What did you do?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Uh, s-see for yourself."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Whoa!
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Yeah, e-everything's frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,For how long?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,I don't know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month?
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Worst movie ever.
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,Dumb.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Ooh, boy, what a waste of time."
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen."
1,Ricksy Business,Summer,This has been so much fun.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that ""wubba lubba dub dub"" thing that you usually say."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,Don't need to. I have a  new catchphrase.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty,"Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick?"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,love my grandkids.
1,Ricksy Business,Morty and Summer in unison,Aww.
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, ""I don't give a fuck""."
1,Ricksy Business,Rick and the song,"? Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ? ? just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ? Roll credits! ? Just shake that a-- Roll the credits! Go! ? Just shake that ass That's the end of season one!"
1,Ricksy Business,Rick,"That's the end, motherfucker! ""I don't give a fuck"" is my new catchphrase! Fuck you! That's season one! Boom! Season one up in your face, motherfucker! Yeah!"
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,Revenge.
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,What?!
1,Ricksy Business,Shirtless guy,Party!
1,Ricksy Business,Shirtless guy,"Whoo, baby!"
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,"Please, stop!"
1,Ricksy Business,Shirtless Guy,"Hey, brah!"
1,Ricksy Business,Abradolph Lincoler,I don't understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?
1,Ricksy Business,Shirtless Guy,"Yeah, you know it, dawg! Whoo, baby!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Bachelor,Cynthia...
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Oh, my God! No, no..!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,I told you!
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,Hold on.
1,Rixty Minutes,Bachelor,Will you please... NOT marry me-- I choose Veronica.
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,What?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Yes!
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,Called it.
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,Why would he choose Veronica?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Because he loves her?
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Well if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Okay, I've got an idea, Rick: you show us your concept of ""good TV"", and we'll crap all over that."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,I thought you'd never ask.
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Hey!
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"20% accurate, as usual,  Morty.  The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn?
1,Rixty Minutes,Corn Man 1,We're not so different. We're both corn of action.
1,Rixty Minutes,Corn Man 2,Yeah... But one of us is dead corn!
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,Bor-ing.
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Summer,  you just spent  three months watching a man choose a fake wife."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"So, what, It'd be better if the people were corn?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look."
1,Rixty Minutes,Glenn,This shit is delicious.
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,A movie about a guy eating shit.  A violent Antiques Show...
1,Rixty Minutes,Letterman,It's a pleasure to have you.
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,The pleasure's all mine.
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous.
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Wait!
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,What in the hell?
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,I agree. Where's this going?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"No, the other thing! Go back!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Really? All right, fine."
1,Rixty Minutes,Woman,"Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked."
1,Rixty Minutes,Announcer,"Coming up next on ""Shmloo's the Shmloss"", Shmlony has a nightmare."
1,Rixty Minutes,Shmlony,"Shmlantha, Schmlona!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with "Schmla".
1,Rixty Minutes,Shmlony,"Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan--"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"All right, that got, that actually got old pretty quick."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel."
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"Go back, go back!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,Jeez.
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,You speak da tru-tru.
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,Oh my God! Dad's in "Cloud Atlas"!
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,I'm in "Cloud Atlas"! What's "Cloud Atlas"?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru.
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,How is this possible?
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Infinite timelines, infinite possibilities - including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Ju-- Wa-- Look at this."
1,Rixty Minutes,Host in Trenchcoat,"And now, another Quick Mystery."
1,Rixty Minutes,Cop,I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty!
1,Rixty Minutes,Killer 1,I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints.
1,Rixty Minutes,Judge,Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison.
1,Rixty Minutes,Host in Trenchcoat,Here's another Quick Mystery.
1,Rixty Minutes,Man,My mother's dead!

1,Rixty Minutes,Killer 3,I'm the killer!
1,Rixty Minutes,Host in Trenchcoat,"Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions, a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?"
1,Rixty Minutes,"Beth, Summer, and Jerry",Narcissism. The narcisstic stuff. I want to obsess about myself.
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Here.  These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes.  Go fetch!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth and Summer,Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"I'm proud of you, Morty."
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson,"I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can't-- I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing!  And also I can't feel anything either-- did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my-- All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know."
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee--  Give me those!
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,What do you see?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Whiteness... Pure whiteness.
1,Rixty Minutes,Johnny Depp,"You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"Haven't we spent enough time on you?  I'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon."
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,I am a real surgeon.
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Ahh, uh-- Summer's turn!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,Finally! I don't see anything.
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born-- That came out wrong, that came out very wrong."
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,"Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me.  We're playing Yahtzee."
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Announcer,"It's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. It's the brand-new Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise.  It's polite, it's right, and it's Sneezy Deezy Mc-fucking Deluxe."
1,Rixty Minutes,Mr. Sneezy 3D,"Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone."
1,Rixty Minutes,Announcer,"It's in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came. And that's when things got knocked into 12th gear."
1,Rixty Minutes,Announcer,"A Mexican armada shows up. With weapons made from Two--tomatoes. And you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business. In Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a Van From an Asteroid and All Sorts of Things THE MOVIE! Hold on, there's more! Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross-attack these two brothers. But let's get back to the brothers, because they're-- they have a strong bond. You don't want to know about it here, but I'll tell you one thing: The moon, it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It's two brothers and--and th-they're - It's called Two Brothers. Two brothers!  It's just called Two Brothers."
1,Rixty Minutes,,
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Come on! Time's up!  I'm taming a lion! No, wait, uhh there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie.  You get the idea. I work with lions."
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,"Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee,  we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know, predictable?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,What are you talking about?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"All this time, you've been thinking, ""What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"""
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,Um--
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Well now you know: you'd be a doctor.  Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht--  banging Kristen Stewart!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,You thought about getting an abortion?
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it. So you're welcome."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Yeah, you're welcome."
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,"Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?  Mm!  Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called ""Ball Fondlers"". I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,I'm in heaven right now.
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,This might be the best day of my life.
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,So now what do we do?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting.
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,Dad!
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,"Well, I'm leaving!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"You can't leave, you're 17!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,"Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age. I'm gonna... move to the southwest and-- I don't know, do something with turquoise."
1,Rixty Minutes,Announcer,"It's Saturday Night Live! Starring A Piece of Toast! Two guys with handle-bar mustaches! A man painted silver who makes robot noises! Garmanarnar!

1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Interesting fun fact, uh? Moynihan and Piece of Toast hate each other. Apparently they've got some real creative differences."

1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"See, that must be where he lives. OK..."

1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Wait wait, Rick! Hold on hold on..."
1,Rixty Minutes,Fake Doors Salesman,"...give it a second thought. That's our slogan. See it on the bottom of the screen, below our name. Here's another slogan, right below that one. What are you worried about? Come get fake doors! Get in here quick, get out quicker, with an arm of fake doors in you arms."
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Okay, okay, you can change it."
1,Rixty Minutes,Fake Doors Salesman,Don't even worry about it!
1,Rixty Minutes,Gazorpazorpfield,I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I really could go for some enchiladas.
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where-where uh, where those Sex robots came from, remember? That whole thing?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Yeah hey, that's pretty, pretty that's true. That's right!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield!
1,Rixty Minutes,Gazorpazorpfield,"Hey Jon, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield. Boy, fuck you, Jon. You dumb, stupid, idiot."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jon,"Come on, Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Gazorpazorpfield,"You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white uh, uh guilt, white guilt, milquetoast piece of human garbage."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jon,"Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, that's-- you know you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake."
1,Rixty Minutes,Gazorpazorpfield,"I don't give a fuck! I'm Gazorpazorp-fucking-field, bitch!  Now give me my fucking enchiladas!"
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Hey, Rick, you know, di-did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray."
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive."
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean."
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,Did you really talk me out of the abortion?
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic."
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to... do something with turquoise."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Which is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it."
1,Rixty Minutes,Beth,"So, we didn't do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves... or..."
1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,Or?
1,Rixty Minutes,Spokesman,"Man. Woman. And now, trunk man? We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners.

1,Rixty Minutes,Police Chief,"Baby Legs, you're a good detective? but not good enough, because of your baby legs. So I'm partnering you up with Regular Legs."
1,Rixty Minutes,Regular Legs,Hey there.
1,Rixty Minutes,Baby Legs,"Detective, I'm-- this is upsetting to me, because I feel like I don't need no regular-leg partner."
1,Rixty Minutes,Police Chief,"Baby Legs, don't talk back to me. Good luck you two, there's a criminal to kill."
1,Rixty Minutes,Regular Legs,Wow! You sure found this guy quick!

1,Rixty Minutes,Baby Legs,"Baby Legs, here we go!  That's the sound I make, when I'm trying to run fast.  All right, I'm not going to get him. I'm, I-I just learned a real valuable lesson."

1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole. World. So, we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own - rotting - corpse."
1,Rixty Minutes,Summer,"So, you're not my brother?"

1,Rixty Minutes,Jerry,"Well, how does that work? I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Morty,"Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and like walk around on their own?"
1,Rixty Minutes,Rick,"Look, I don't know! I'm watching the-- same thing you guys are."

1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Beth,"Morty, I think it will be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad."

1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,I also know you long for female company.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Goldenfold,"You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can't be filled with jamba juice."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge: one never pays here. Not with money.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Goldenfold,Nothing to read into there! Thanks!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Sorry I'm late, Mr. Needful. This is my grandpa Rick, he was just leaving."

1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Grandpa Rick!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Hey, I'm not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I'm a man of science."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Ahah. Then perhaps you could make use of this.  This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Hahahaha.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Hahahahaha.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Grandpa, go home and drink!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Why don't we do a model of the solar system? That's what my dad did with me when I was your age.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Oh. Ok.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"You know, Rick's in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how ?bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto's a planet."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Of course Pluto's a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Morty, nobody changed the planets."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"I just googled it. Uh, Pluto's not a planet. They changed it in 2006."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,You? disagree?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"That's right. It's possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Um, ok, I just have to-"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Damn!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Oh.  Okay good. This is gonna be fun!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Um?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Cute. Your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Uh, Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled. I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick. I think the word's just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Well that's retarded.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,What are you guys talking about?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Apparently nothing.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"You asked him if Pluto's a planet, didn't you?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,No!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,It's not.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Shut up, Rick."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Whoa.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"I don't care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Stay scientific, Jerry."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Goldenfold,This aftershave made women want me but it also made me impotent!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"A price for everything, Mr. Goldenfold. A price? for everything! Muahahahaha!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Goldenfold,Oh my god! How can I not see this coming? My lust! My greed! I deserve thi-
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,This serum should counteract the negative effects.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Goldenfold,"Holy cats! Ladies, let's get out of here."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Goldenfold,I haven't learned a thing!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Here. You can have this back.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,You didn't use it?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say,  a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Be quiet!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Don't you want to make sure people know what they're getting? You're not intentionally selling  beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,I find this all quite preposterous!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo.  That's beautiful, you know it's going to be wearing you in three hours?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Do I need to call the police?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Here, you can use my phone. Don't worry, it won't make you deaf because I'm not a hack."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Hey! No! Ugh!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Think you're so great?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Stop it!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"No! Stop! Hey, hey! Stop it right now!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Grandpa Rick, I like working here!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,You work for the devil!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,So what?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick and Needful,"""So what""?!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Yes, so what if he's the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he's active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food, and make gadgets. Buh bye."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Whoops.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"I'm sorry Mr. Needful, I'll clean that up. I don't know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"It's fine. Summer, you know your grandfather's right. This store curses people. That's my business."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Well, yeah, fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn't evil? This is my first job. You've been nice to me, Mr. Needful. You respect me."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Please, call me the devil."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"I'd rather not, actually."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Yes, perhaps not during business hours."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! ? Well, then my son's going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I'm suing you first!  I think I know what the A in NASA stands for."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Dad, what's your endgame?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Ain't no game, sucka."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets? It's even easier!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn't always easy, Morty!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry and Morty,"Whoa, whoa! Whoa!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,What the hell?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"I'm King Flippynips, ruler of Pluto!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,I was? you know? sometimes science is about conviction.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Oh. I?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"Plutonians! Jerry Smith is a scientist from Earth where he's creating a model of our solar system! Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Pluto? is a planet.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"Pluto's a fucking planet, bitch!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"If it's athletic prowess you desire, principal Vagina, I might-"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Vagina,I'll take it!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,But I haven't even-
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Vagina,"Thank you very very much, great store, great place, bye."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Huh. Okay. I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I've had since Salem!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Nice! Wholesome delight for lunch?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Is that the vegan place?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Yeah, I love their soup."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,I'm kind of souped out.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Tate,"Oh, is there a limit? Everything's free, right?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Let's just say? you don't pay with money.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,That was perfect.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Tate,"You pay with the curses, right?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Um, I? well-"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,But Mrs. Tate! Why do you want cursed items?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Tate,"Well, I'm going to get the curses removed. At curse purge plus. You know, the guy on TV?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,What?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Have you acquired creepy, specific old stuff from an antique or thrift store that gives you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to Curse Purge Plus! I use science to uncurse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers! This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster! But guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I dunno, $8,000,000? See ya at the Olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Baby,Everything's deductible.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We're located at First and Main in old town. Come on, come on down."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,First? and?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Wubba? lubba? dub dub!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Wubba lubba dub dub!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"That's right across the street from Needful Things, where you can get evil items for free!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Diabolical son of a mother-
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Hostess,"We're back on Good Morning Pluto, and a very good morning it is for our guest, Earth scientist Jerry Smith, who is making headlines with his bold announcement that is, what Jerry?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Pluto is a planet.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Host,How about that?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Hostess,Wow. I love it!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,Morty Smith. I'm Scroopy Noopers. I'm a scientist. Can I show you something?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Uh? I'd better not.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,Right now.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,"The centre of Pluto, Mr. Smith, is made up of a substance called plutonium. Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,"There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists had noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn't even call it a planet any more. Should have been our wake up call. But the rich plutonians won't wake up. And they love your dad telling everyone Pluto's a planet, because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally, poof."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Um? A party?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,Is everyone in your family an idiot?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,For sure me and my dad are.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,"Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is? my dad's really insecure."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Hm, funny. Mr Needful, out of everything in the store you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Ah! Oh my god!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Oh my god.  I wish this desk was lighter!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,I wish this knot was looser!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Come on! I don't? Augh! Wait! What am I doing?  I wish I knew CPR!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"One, two, three! One, two, three!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Ugh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Mr. Needful! How could you even think of doing something so horrible?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"I'm the devil. What should I do when I fail, give myself an ice-cream?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,You haven't failed.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean seriously, I may be the devil but your grandpa is the devil! I just want to go back to hell where everybody thinks I'm smart and funny."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"No! It's not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick! I was your only friend, and I get nothing?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Okay, I'll give you one thing. Name it."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,I wanna help you.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Clever twist.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"I learned from the best, you old fart. Now let's go get you hydrated."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Looks like we've got? haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you'll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you'll have some time travelling mittens."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby! How's business?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Here's the last of our inventory. We're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Sounds like code for ?You win, Rick!?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"That was important to you, wasn't it?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,He tried to kill himself.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"But you know what, grandpa Rick? He's strong. And he's never going to give up."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Uh huh, yeah, I don't care."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don't care."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,So?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,So? have fun not caring.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,I always do.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Good.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Yeah, it is good. It's the best."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,I'm sure it is. Bye.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Later!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Customer,I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Employee,These are the forms for the employee health plan.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Alright, yeah, uh, put 'em on my? eh."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,I just got bored. Everybody out.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we'll get back to your science project."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Dad, Pluto isn't a planet! It's shrinking because of corporations!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,You told me science wasn't easy!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"I said science isn't always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Dad, their whole planet is dying!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"What's up, Pluto?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Plutonian woman,"Mr. Smith, please! Tell my friend here what you just told me, go on."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Plutonian man,My god! The man's a genius!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Um, excuse me?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Morty, what?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"I mean, I'm trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Good one, dad."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh.  Hey Beth? Hello?  Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Thanks. Hey, y?know, I was thinking I might watch a movie?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Butter robot,I am not programmed for friendship.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Suit yourself.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Hey!  Hey. What's going on?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Um? listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Whatever.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"Jerry, you must be so excited! The Plutobell Prize is the highest honour a scientist can receive!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"I'm flattered, and humbled."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"Ooh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet, people like that."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Policeman,Your highness! We've captured Scroopy Noopers!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,You animals! Animals!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"Ooh, look whose little journey's come to an end! Take him to Plutonimo Bay!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Scroopy Noopers,"You can't kill the truth, father!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,What?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"I can see you're confused. Plutonimo bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words-"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,It's a what?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Flippynips,"Huh? Oh- planet! Hah! Hoh, Pluto is a cold cold planet! That's what I meant. Knock 'em dead out there, you."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Pluto is?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Not a planet.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Crowd,Boo!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Ow! It's not a planet! Hey! It's not a planet! I'm an idiot, and I love my son!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"It's been a long six hours, but we've overhauled Needful Things into the globally compliant, web 4.0 e-nomenon, n33dful.com! Spelled with 3s instead of Es."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Crowd,Woot! Yeah! Woot! Excited!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"Okay, that's it! We just got bought by Google!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Crowd,Yeah!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Mmh! I'm so proud of you, Lucius. So? how much did we make?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Haha. ?We.?  This is my business! Security!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Ah! You're Zuckerberging me?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,"I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped. I'm the devil, beeyotch! What what!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Hey!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Hey Morty.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Oh! Hey dad!  Um? What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Ah, some people just can't handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I'm not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"Hey, dad? Nobody's smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You're a genius at that."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,"Wow? that's humbling? and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,Um? I'm just going to take this thing in and? get an A.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Butter robot,Butter.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,But-
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"You're a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you're ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14! I got a computer in here, you know!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,Oh. I uh- I think I underst-
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"You know you're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,I get it! Say no more.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Morty,"I mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna, you're gonna end up seeing something-"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Jerry,I got it! Noted! Goodnight!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,How's your pretend grandpa doing AKA the devil?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,He dumped me.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Oof, sorry."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Hm, not sure."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty and you didn't realise how much you valued my approval?"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"No, that's dumb."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Nah, not satisfying."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"I'll tell you what though, if it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea."
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Uh huh? uh huh? uh huh totally let's do it!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,And that's how I took my storefront into the forefront of the upfront! Thank you Seattle!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Rick? Summer?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Stupid mother-
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Stupid bitch!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Stupid motherfucker!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Get some!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,How do you like that! Augh! How do you like that?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Needful,Ugh? Why?
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,We did it!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,"Haha, yeah bro. Yeah! Haha!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,"Was totally worth it! We did it, hahaha! We just pulled it off!"
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Yeah bro!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Rick,Hahaha!
1,Something Ricked This Way Comes,Summer,Yeah.
1,Pilot,Rick,Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.
1,Pilot,Morty,"What, Rick? Whats going on?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"I got a surprise for you, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up."
1,Pilot,Morty,Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!
1,Pilot,Rick,"We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty."
1,Pilot,Rick,"What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had I had to I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb."
1,Pilot,Morty,What?! A bomb?!
1,Pilot,Rick,"We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start."
1,Pilot,Morty,T-t-that's absolutely crazy!
1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica."
1,Pilot,Morty,Jessica? From my math class?
1,Pilot,Rick,"When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam."
1,Pilot,Morty,Ohh...
1,Pilot,Rick,And Jessica's gonna be Eve.
1,Pilot,Morty,Whhhh-wha?
1,Pilot,Rick,"And so that's the surprise, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! Butbut, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!"
1,Pilot,Rick,"I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you dont gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"What are you talking about, Rick?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she she, she, she's all for you, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou
1,Pilot,Rick,"You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways."
1,Pilot,Morty,"That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Get off of me, Morty!"
1,Pilot,Morty,"I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm putIm, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin... I-Im, Im, Im not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!"
1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on! Whats gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why dont you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty."
1,Pilot,Rick,Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. Ill land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
1,Pilot,Rick,"We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, thank god."
1,Pilot,Rick,"You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive."
1,Pilot,Morty,It was?
1,Pilot,Rick,"Sure. Why not? I dont, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo"
1,Pilot,Morty,Um...
1,Pilot,Jerry,I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?
1,Pilot,Summer,"Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke."
1,Pilot,Beth,"Morty, are you getting sick?  I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. The dog sleeps on it."
1,Pilot,Morty,"I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something."
1,Pilot,Summer,Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick.
1,Pilot,Jerry,What?
1,Pilot,Beth,Dad?
1,Pilot,Rick,"What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?"
1,Pilot,Jerry,Damn it!
1,Pilot,Beth,Jerry!
1,Pilot,Jerry,Beth!
1,Pilot,Summer,"Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay, with all due respect, Rick what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you somethingtell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then thethen the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them."
1,Pilot,Beth,"Oh, dad"
1,Pilot,Jerry,What? For real?
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Alright, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows!"
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math? And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in. Two plus two."
1,Pilot,Morty,Jessica.
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Five plus five.
1,Pilot,Morty,Jessica.
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Okay, good. It's time for the quiz."
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room.  There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3"
1,Pilot,Jessica,"Hi, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Whoa! Hi, Jessica."
1,Pilot,Jessica,Can I show these to you?
1,Pilot,Morty,Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!
1,Pilot,Jessica,You know what I named these? My little Morties.
1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird."
1,Pilot,Jessica,Do you know what I want you to do with them?
1,Pilot,Morty,Rename them?
1,Pilot,Jessica,"Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot."
1,Pilot,Jessica,"Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?"
1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, I-I'm just doing my best."
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Morty! What are you doing to me?!
1,Pilot,Morty,"Ah, Jessica."
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Morty!
1,Pilot,Morty,Jessica.
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad."
1,Pilot,Morty,Je-Jessica. Jessica.
1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Not my fault this is happening.
1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, morning, Frank."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it."
1,Pilot,Rick,"There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!"
1,Pilot,Morty,"Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go."
1,Pilot,Summer,"Hi, Frank."
1,Pilot,Summer,AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
1,Pilot,Beth,Scalpel.
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Knock, knock."
1,Pilot,Beth,Jerry?
1,Pilot,Jerry,"My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"""
1,Pilot,Beth,"Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia."
1,Pilot,Beth,"Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, yeah, on horses."
1,Pilot,Beth,Excuse me?
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home."
1,Pilot,Beth,"Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!"
1,Pilot,Rick,"There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, okay."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing."
1,Pilot,Rick,"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be"
1,Pilot,Rick,"HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!"
1,Pilot,Rick,"I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!"
1,Pilot,Rick,"Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."
1,Pilot,Morty,"All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?"
1,Pilot,Morty,The mega trees?
1,Pilot,Rick,"That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school."
1,Pilot,Morty,"All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together."
1,Pilot,Morty,AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
1,Pilot,Rick,"You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!"
1,Pilot,Beth,"I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?"
1,Pilot,Jerry,"I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son."
1,Pilot,Beth,"It's fine, Davin."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies."
1,Pilot,Beth,"Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, maybe you're right."
1,Pilot,Beth,"Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?"
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Ahem, Horse heart surgeon."
1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze."
1,Pilot,Morty,"I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!"
1,Pilot,Rick,"Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?"
1,Pilot,Morty,"Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Okay, hold on just a second, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!
1,Pilot,Morty,"Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?"
1,Pilot,Morty,"Sure thing, Rick."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick."
1,Pilot,Rick,"There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left."
1,Pilot,Morty,What?!
1,Pilot,Rick,"It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?"
1,Pilot,Rick,"There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid."
1,Pilot,Morty,Uh-oh.
1,Pilot,Rick,"When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,In my butt?
1,Pilot,Rick,"Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty"
1,Pilot,Morty,Uuuh.
1,Pilot,Rick,"And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt."
1,Pilot,Morty,In my butt?
1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man."
1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months."
1,Pilot,Beth,What? Why didn't you notify us?
1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather?
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?"
1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school."
1,Pilot,Beth,Summer?
1,Pilot,Summer,What kind of God lets this happen?
1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death.  And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them.
1,Pilot,Announcer,The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
1,Pilot,Announcer,The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
1,Pilot,Rick,"I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?"
1,Pilot,Morty,"Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt."
1,Pilot,Rick,"That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-"
1,Pilot,Rick,Why does he have to go over there?
1,Pilot,Rick,What new-  what new machine?
1,Pilot,Rick,"Run, Morty! Run!"
1,Pilot,Morty,Aaaaaah!
1,Pilot,Morty,Ohhhhh!
1,Pilot,Morty,Ohhhhhh!
1,Pilot,Morty,Aaaaah!
1,Pilot,Rick,Don't think about it!
1,Pilot,Rick,"Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher."
1,Pilot,Morty,Whoooooo!
1,Pilot,Rick,"I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody."
1,Pilot,Rick,"They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!"
1,Pilot,Morty,"They're not robots, Rick!"
1,Pilot,Rick,"It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!"
1,Pilot,Morty,Holy crap! This is insane!
1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!"
1,Pilot,Jessica,Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding."
1,Pilot,Jessica,"You're Morty, right?"
1,Pilot,Morty,Yeah.
1,Pilot,Rick,"You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche."
1,Pilot,Beth,What?
1,Pilot,Jerry,"I'm an angry father, not an improviser."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?"
1,Pilot,Rick,You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
1,Pilot,Jerry,You're beyond our reasoning!
1,Pilot,Rick,Takes one to know one.
1,Pilot,Beth,"Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's."
1,Pilot,Rick,What what are you guys doing with my stuff?
1,Pilot,Beth,We're moving you to a nursing home.
1,Pilot,Rick,"A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas."
1,Pilot,Beth,What does that mean?
1,Pilot,Jerry,It's personal.
1,Pilot,Morty,"Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own."
1,Pilot,Rick,What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?
1,Pilot,Beth,"Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes."
1,Pilot,Rick,I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Oh, for crying outhe's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?"
1,Pilot,Morty,I do?
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't."
1,Pilot,Rick,"The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!"
1,Pilot,Morty,1.77245385... Whoa!
1,Pilot,Beth,What the hell?
1,Pilot,Jerry,Holy crap. He's right.
1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."
1,Pilot,Morty,"""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I'm so smart!"
1,Pilot,Jerry,But
1,Pilot,Rick,I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
1,Pilot,Beth,"Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop."
1,Pilot,Jerry,"No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication."
1,Pilot,Summer,Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!
1,Pilot,Rick,No idea what you're talking about.
1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you."
1,Pilot,Beth,You know what? Okay.
1,Pilot,Morty,"Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Aw, man."
1,Pilot,Rick,"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty."
1,Pilot,Morty,"Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh."
1,Pilot,Rick,"I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Outside?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Are you kidding me?! Come on!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Oh, my God."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What's wrong?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Your idiot dog!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Morty, come on. I need your help tonight."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Ha-ha!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Aw, man!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"All right, Ruffles What's his name?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Snuffles.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Snuffles, shake."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Roll over.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Go to the bathroom.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Holy crap!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,No way.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"That was fantastic, Rick!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,W-w-w-what is it?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,You talking about "Inception"?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"""Inception"" made sense."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You don't know me!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,"' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You don't know me!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Uh-oh! Spoilers!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,I'm a full season behind.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,Wheat thins. Wheat thins.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,I'll take two.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,"Oh, I think you've had enough, sir."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"All right, Morty, time to make our move."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,Make it bounce.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,"No, you didn't."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, jiggle it now."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You better stop with that.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Take cover, Morty!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Ooohhh!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Now bring me my slippers.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Now, be my footstool, Snuffles."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Aw, he's saying ""I love lasagna""."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Ooooyayawawa!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"He's saying ""I love Obama"".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Hmm?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,"Hey, you don't know me!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You don't know m-
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"All right, let's go."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Don't judge, Morty."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Ooh, oh! Oh, man."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"I'm sorry. No, no."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"No, thanks!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"No, I'm okay."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Whoa!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"It's Summer! Aw, geez."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Time to go another dream deep, Morty!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oh, here we go!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Snuffles fix. Make better.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Why not?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,I don't know. It's Indian giving.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,The little girl!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Huh?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Ohhhh!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Do not call me that!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"""Snuffles"" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Scaring you?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Uhhh ...
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Yeah. Totally. Let's go.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,You will walk when it is time to walk.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oh, yeah."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Buckle up, bitch!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Ooooooaaahhh!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,But that's the opposite of what-
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,You can run But you can't hide!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Dad, he wants to be called snowball."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,I don't want to talk about it!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, uh, um ... ""Bitch."""
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, hey, it's you guys!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"If you guys ever need anything, just say the word."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,I always hated that song!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"These halves don't belong together, bitch!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,Sex is sacred!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,"Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an ""A"" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What the hell?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, man, what's going on?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,This is why I choose to get C's.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,- Dad! - Rick!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Bad person. Bad.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Ooh, great plan, Jerry."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Th-thanks, snuffles."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Begin phase two.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,But I-it's been like a whole year!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Aw, man, geez! Seriously?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What?!
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,We are not them! We are not them.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"I'm gonna miss you, snowball."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Beth,Jerry?
1,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller.
1,Lawnmower Dog,Beth,"Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick."
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"What do you know, Morty? What do you know?"
1,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch."
1,Rick Potion 9,Principal Vagina,"Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you, I'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,What's up Morty?
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,Ugghh
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,What are you doing?
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,Ummm
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,"Wait, wait, Were you about to talk... to her?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Well, I mean, I was thinking about it."
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,"Dude, Stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don't see me going to a bigger school, in a wealthier district and hittin' on their prettiest girl!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,"Gee, thanks, Brad."
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,"I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought..."
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE."
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"My marriage is fine, thank you."
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that."
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom."
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Oh well, okay..."
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,Oww!
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof."
1,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Ugh, unless she has the flu."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Beth, do you still love me?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Beth,Want kinda question is that?
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,The "yes" or "no" kind.
1,Rick Potion 9,Beth,"Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,Yess.
1,Rick Potion 9,Beth,Are you gonna build them?
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,Noo.
1,Rick Potion 9,Beth,Then what good was the "yes"?
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Beth,"Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say ""no"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,Sort of.
1,Rick Potion 9,Beth,"But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,This late?
1,Rick Potion 9,Beth,"The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,"Omigod, Morty. You look REALLY nice tonight."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"WOW, thanks!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,"I love you, Morty. I love you so much it burns!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,"Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,"LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK!  I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE'S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,"Aw man, Morty, ugh, I'm really sorry."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Oh, well, no problem Brad."
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,"There's somethin' special bout you, somethin' special."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Whoa, take it easy!"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,BACK OFF I'M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!
1,Rick Potion 9,Principal Vagina,That's enough Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,"Oh, Principal Vagina."
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,"Never leave me, Morty, NEVER."
1,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?"
1,Rick Potion 9,Jessica,Who cares? Just hold me.
1,Rick Potion 9,Brad,LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU MORTY!
1,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.
1,Rick Potion 9,Summer,"Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,All,Love. Connection. Experience.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Yeah Morty
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,All,"Come together. With love. connection, experience!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,It's my favourite song.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Hahahahaha, yeah."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh yeah, distress beacon!  Yeah baby!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,You're excited about that?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty and Summer,Whoa!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Seems like something terrible happened here.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Uh, what's that?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,That's horrible!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"I hear you man, cops are racist."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Female alien,Can you help us? Our planet was taken over by some kind of  entity! It absorbed the minds of our people!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Male alien 1,"We didn't notice until it was too late. The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not, themselves any more; They're part of It."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Male alien with glasses,"Hey! No, no- uurgh!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Called it.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,All six aliens together,Hello Rick. Long time no see.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Unity!?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,Rick?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Grandpa?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"After we broke up, I spend some time wandering through space,"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"then I found this world,"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,You mean stealing peoples?? bodies?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Ugh.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Wait! Rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"You're guests here on my planet, you're free to be yourselves; I've never been good at disappointing Rick."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Well now I'm going to barf. Come on Morty.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Jerry, what are you- what are you doing in here?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"I'm trying to find our weed whacker, ??cause our weeds are wack, yo."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,But you can't go in the garage when Rick's not here.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,I can't?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Well, he doesn't like it."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"What's he gonna do, crash rent-free at his other family's house?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,What is that supposed to mean?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues! He's playing you, shorty."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,Stop shifting the crosshairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is toe-up from the flow-up.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,What the hell was that?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"I don't know, let's just leave!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,That is a hatch! Your father put a hatch in my garage!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"You don't know it was him!  Anyway, we?'re not supposed to be in here!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what's next?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"After I become a type-one civilisation, this world will be invited into the Galactic Federation."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh, goody."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,From there I'll have access to countless planets and species.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the single-minded once called a god."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"I like that. Oh, that's pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Recreational substances were phased out here. There's no need for escape from the self when your world is one.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Rick, when we met I was a young hivemind with the population of a small town. People... change."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Especially when I change them. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but... I?'ve grown."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Hey, listen, I?'ve grown too. I have! See, I?'ve- I?'ve reconnected with my family, right?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Hm, why is that I wonder?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Maybe it's part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with... a collective.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Yes Rick! Yes! Yes!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Oh yeah!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Yes! Yes!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,Look at ?'em go! So coordinated! What?'s your problem? They?'re making you into a Mount Rushmore! They made burgers!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Morty, open your eyes! There is no they! These poor people's?? bodies are being used! They're a planet of puppets!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I can hear you.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Ugh!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Well, seems like everybody here's cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"No, we don't want your dumb balloons. We?'re bored. Take us back to Rick."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Now's... not a good time.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Go son go! Go son go! Go son go!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,Oh! Real nice! Real nice! How does a man do this without me noticing?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Oh, you know my dad. Once he puts his mind to something..."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,You're spinning this to his credit?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,I'm going down there.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,Jerry!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair,  and my faceless gargler. Now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Okay, you're just making stuff up now."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Oh my god. Oh my god.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Oh Rick, it was so bad."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,What's this ??was?? stuff? I just need to hydrate and then we?'re doing that again!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Oh damn.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I'll- I'll be back to have sex with the survivors."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"It's a neighboring hivemind species, Beta-7. Our planet's maintained a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources.  So be nice!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,Unity.  Is it a... bad time? Are all... present lifeforms... assimilated?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Beta-7, this is my single-minded friend from Earth, Rick."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,Rick... Sanchez. Unity has spoken of you.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,All bad I hope.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Whoa, Jesus Christ!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Beta-7, if my allies are a problem for you perhaps our alliance is as well."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,Our alliance is beneficial. When Beta-7 expresses concern it- it's only ... be-because...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Oh snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know what I can make with this stuff?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Oh... Rick, I- I shouldn't..."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Come on, it's not every day that I'm in town! It- it's for old time's sake."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Uh... Okay, what the hell! We can purify the resin and make fractal dust!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but..."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Aww, old man Rick can't party with the whole planet?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"I can do whatever you do and more, baby."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,Hrmm...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"Well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,Well. Nice. Real nice. Alien prisoners under the house. Real nice. Nice. Reeeal-
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Goddamn it, stop."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Wake up people! You have to fight it! You're under the spell of an evil monster!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I can hear you.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Yeah! So you keep saying!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,Summer!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Why do you hate me, Summer?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,I'm not talking to you! I'm talking to...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,...Steven Phillips! Steven! Set yourself free!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"...Yeah, well so what? At least he was himself."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide. Now she's a marine biologist.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Listen Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she's just saying that life would be... you know, life."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I have transformed life here into a paradise. Prostitutes are now scientists. The homeless are now phisosophers.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Oh, phi- phisosophers?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Philophiluh... phiphophibup...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Oh my god. Where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I'm feeling... urk!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,Oh man! Let me help all of you guys up!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I'm fine!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Do you know what I love about you, Rick? You're the only single mind I?'ve met who really sees the big picture."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"You got that right. But... baby, listen. Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta... you gotta just... remember to let go sometimes, you know."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"I can let go! Hey, look! You see that town across the river? Watch this."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Whoa!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Ha ha! Woot!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Whoa! That's not what I meant!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"It's okay! It's okay, I evacuated! I evacuated the town, look!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Hey! Right here! We?'re fine!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren't in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? ... H-hey, my drink is empty."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty and Summer,Aah!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Unity, what's happening?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Steven Phillips,Who's Unity? You kids have nice feet. Mind if I take a picture?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Gross, no!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer. Something's happening to Unity."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Do... all of you remember who you are?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Ron Benson,"...Yeah. My name is Ron Benson. I'm... an electrical engineer. Father of two, and as you can see from my flat concentric nipple rings, I'm a member of this planet's top race!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Okay, that's good! Uh... Don't focus too much on the last part, but..."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Daryl Jefferson,I'm Daryll Jefferson. I'm a landscaper. And I'll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch's race is superior!  The cone-nipple people will rule this world!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Ron Benson,"You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastard!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Daryl Jefferson,"What'd you say to me, you target-chested piece of shit?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Alien man,Race war!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Why are you fighting? Can't you see you're all the same?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Ah, Summer. Ha ha. First race war, huh?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Way to go, Summer. You started a race war."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,I didn't start it! They're the racists! I... I  merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Okay, thanks for clarifying! Y- I'll have a super accurate headstone now!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rioter,"Hey wait, what race are you guys?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,We?'re neither! S-see?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Yeah, take my word for it. We just have regular nipples."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rioter,Hey! These two freaks have no race!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Oh, there's no place like home! There's no place like home! Remember, Summer?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Oh...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"O-oh, yes, yes yes..."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,All the tiny people?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Dorothy, take us away! Take us away!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Hello Summer. Hello Morty.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,It's okay! You're safe now.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,U-Unity?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Yes.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Oh, Unity I am so sorry. I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks! I was thinking more of... a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong! I'm having fun with your grandpa! Lost a little control. Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be... running two hundred thousand pediatric hospitals and twelve million deep friers, but hey! It's not like this planet can take its business elsewhere!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Um... should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or...?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn't have gotten drunk! Wooohoooo!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,Oh man. I cannot wait. I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this. He is gone!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Jerry, stop! Please, okay, we weren't even supposed to be down here. If we confront him about this-"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"Oh my god! I love this! I love that this is how far you will go for him. You wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a Lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,Oh listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person! Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing! It's a monster! He might have it chained up so that it doesn't eat the planet!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"Right, because your father's such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for humans! He's probably harvesting this creature's organs!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,He's probably racing to cure its space aids!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,He's going to eat it!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,He's protecting it!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Both,Shut up!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Unity! This place is a mess!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Oh, it's cool! The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday.  Oh my god! I have a meeting at the galactic federation in an hour. Oh, I'll never make it! Ah, I'll push it to next week."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Unity, could you get Rick out here please?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,He's... unavailable! He's-
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Having sex with you, we get it! Gross. Get him out here now."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I don't think he wants to be-
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Grandpa Rick!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,Rick! Rick!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,What the hell... is your problem?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Grandpa, we need to go home! Now!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Fine, geez!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,See ya!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Uh, Rick? I think we should all go."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Tend your garden, kids, I'm kinda doing a thing here."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Grandpa Rick, we?'re not leaving without you!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Oh my god  you guys I get it. You're afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Actually, no. I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,What?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"This isn't healthy, Rick! Y- you know you-you're really up to no good around here. I-at-at this place,  you know?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,You and Unity are like... like... leggings and mid-calf boots. You think you're great together but you're just bringing out the worst in each other!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks. Unity?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I'm just taking a little break from stuff. You know? I need to relax.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh, hey, wh-what's this on the news, guys? L-l-let me turn it up."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is. We?'re... really just having a good time. Karen?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Thanks, Todd. Up next: Are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill? We'll tell you how you can really know for sure!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,I think you two are a little outnumbered.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Okay! Well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favour to us... because you love us?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,What? Dumb. Bye.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"But Rick, Summer's just-"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what's the word I'm looking for here... uh- human! It runs in the family! I can tolerate it but I can't give a crap about it. Take a hike."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,"Take care of yourself, Unity."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,You're the worst!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,No! You're the worst! You don't support this family!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,All you care about is yourself!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,You think supporting the family is about supporting you emotionally...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,You've got two children being dragged across the cosmos...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"...but you're unsupportable! Because it's never enough, Jerry!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"...by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,It will never be enough support to satisfy you! And you don't even know what it's like...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,Because you'd rather lose them and lose me than lose him!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,...to be afraid of losing anything because you cling and you cling and you cling...
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,"And why? Because you're the child, Beth. You, not me, you!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Jerry,Aaah!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,Oh my god!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth and Jerry,Aah!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Blim Blam,"Um, first of all, hello. Uh, my name is Blim Blam the korblok. Second of all, cards on the table: I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies. However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that I suppose you could call ?'space aids?? as you put it, and Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. At the same time, Rick's motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else's, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks. But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the fucking worst! You both hate yourselves and each other! And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable! I'd laugh but I'm biologically incapable, that's how alien I am! And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck?!? So! Good luck with your shitty marriage, and I'm sorry that Rick has to deal with either of you. Blim Blam, out!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Blim Blam,You know what? I'm taking this.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Blim Blam,How do you- what is this?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Blim Blam,"Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Aaah!  Okay, okay, now make him cry. But happy cry. Now make ?'em all make fun of the blonde one. Now make ?'em all do it on the table! I can?'t believe you created a whole show for me. Now cancel it! Okay, now put it back on. Haha!  Alright, I?'m bored."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty? I feel bad that they-"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I'll be right back. Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you're powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,Never.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Never! Back in a flash.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let's see how long we can go!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Hey Une! You got any more-
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I'm not strong enough to do it in persons."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. And I have no problem with that, but... it clearly means I have a problem with myself."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,I'm sure there's no perfect version of me. I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Unity,"But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way you're better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else's, Unity. P.S. I don't know where those coal miners were before they got assimilated. You might want to get checked."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Hey.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,"Dad...  I... um... Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair... and your alien prisoner. And... he got away. And I know I sound like mom but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety just because I'm afraid you'll leave again, so no more alien prisoners, and, no more subterranean excavation without consulting us."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Okay.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beth,...Okay? Y-y-y-y-Okay like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,No. It's your house.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Summer,Grandpa Rick! What happened... with Unity?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we?'re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It's not cool. Fun's fun but who needs it? I'll be in the garage."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,Unity! Unity! Unity!
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,How can I assist you?
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"I wanna talk to  Unity. Beta-7, I know it's in there!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,"You're classified as a hostile entity, and Unity doesn't want to talk to you."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"I know your game, Beta-7, I?'ve met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,You are classified as a hostile entity.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Well, you're just loving this, mother f- this isn't gonna shape out like you think, pal! Unity's not into other hiveminds! It's gonna suck you in and use you up and a month from now I'm going to be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me! Get out here!"
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Beta-7,Weapons systems engaged.
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"Oh, in your dreams you have weapons systems."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Morty,"Ugh, Rick, you said we were going to a movie."
2,Auto Erotic Assimilation,Rick,"We are, Morty. Alright, Beta-shit-7, you just got saved by the bell, bitch!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"I got to tell you, Rick. It?'s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"I agree, Morty.  Nicee to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year. Ohh!Relax.That?'s what windshields are for."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I didn?'t know that there were bugs out in space.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Well , w-what did you think, Morty? Life just developed on earth by itself? Here, let me take care of this."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Geez, Rick, that?'s disgusting. I don?'t want to look at that."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yeah, guess I?'m out of fluid. L-let me find a place to stop.  Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Guy,The general store ought to have what you need.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Thanks.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Guy,"Of course, you?'ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Guy,Sundown is when the festival begins.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,The festival?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Guy,"Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, I know what this is! You?'ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Guy,That?'s right.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,What?!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"It?'s like ""The Purge,"" Morty. That movie ""The Purge""?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Guy,"Oh, have you been here before?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"No, no, but I?'ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick. You know, sometimes it?'s called The Cleansing or The Red Time. There was this one world that called it just Murder Night. I-it?'s a purge planet. They?'re peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,T-that?'s horrible!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Yeah. You want to check it out?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"So, what do you do during the festival? You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Old Guy,"Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, I bet you do, old timer."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Gee... Rick, come on. The sun is setting. W-we got to get out of here."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"All right, well, w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Old Guy,"It?'s on the house. Oh, and, uh, why... why don?'t you have some candy bars, as well?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, no way. That?'s really nice of you."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Old Guy,I?'m a nice guy... For now.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Ohh, I don?'t doubt it."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Rick!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, have a good festival, old timer."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Old Guy,I intend to.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Rick, unlock it!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Just a second, Morty. Oh, look at that sunset."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Stop screwing around.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,There we go. Much better. Now we can see.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Great.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Hey, you know what, Morty? Why don?'t we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,What?! No! What is your problem?!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Morty, grow up. If you don?'t want to watch, don?'t watch, but, you know, it?'s my car.  Also, if you tell your mom about this, I?'ll purge you."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"You?'re the worst. And this planet is the worst. How can you be into this? You know, people are gonna kill each other."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"So, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that  I-if... if there?'s a video online with someone getting decapitated, you don?'t click on it?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,No! Why... why would I do that? You do that?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"I don?'t, because it would bore me. I see shit like that for breakfast, Morty. But if you don?'t do it, I say it?'s because you?'re afraid of your own primal instincts. So you stuff them down and..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, oh! Shh. Shh. It?'s starting. Oh-ho-ho! Here we go."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I?'m not watching.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal?'s in the mail. I'm gonna get a closer look."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Oh, okay, sure. And then someone?'s gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we?'re gonna crash and we?'re gonna be stuck down there and it?'s gonna be what we deserve."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yawn. Whoa!  Whoa, they are purging the fuck out of each other."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, my God! Oh, shit. That was... okay, yeah. T-that was gross. Wow. Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, Morty. Ugh. My appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick. Oh, God."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Get away from me! No! No! Help! Somebody help me! Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"All right, Morty. L-let?'s get out of here."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. W-we have to go down there."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,What? Why?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,That poor girl. W-we have to save her.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy. We got the wiper fluid. We watched them kill each other. We?'re leaving."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Help me save that girl, or I?'m telling mom you brought me here."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,You little turd.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Please! Leave me alone!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Leave you alone? During a purge? I don?'t think so, baby."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,It?'s okay. We?'re not gonna hurt you.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,My name is Morty. This is my grandpa. We?'re tourists.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Not anymore.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Woman,Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, my God. This is fucking awesome! Morty, this is really cool. Hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people? It?'s fun. We?'re totally justified because we?'re saving a little girl. I mean, w-w-we?'re both free and clear to murder these people."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Are you okay?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Yes. I have to find somewhere to hide.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Well, you can hide with us. Rick?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Yeah?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Do you think we could take... w-what?'s your name?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Arthricia.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Could we take Arthricia up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you?'ve done to blackmail me?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Your vehicle... is it from the gods?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,No.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Yes.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"So, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like, ""wait, what?""This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?"""
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Yeah, I bet.  I bet. Yeah, it?'s kind of like cellphones, you know? At first, everyone was like, ""look at those douchebags purging,"" and then the next thing you know, they?'re like, ""it?'s just so convenient."""
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, Morty?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,"Whatcha doing? Watching some TV, playing on your phone?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Is that a real question?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Just making conversation.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark ""yes"" like a trained animal. It?'s not a conversation. You?'re holding me verbally hostage."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,"Okay, ass-face. I?'ll go in the kitchen."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Hey, dad."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Yeah?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Whatcha doing? Going into the kitchen?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Okay.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Yeah, you like that?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Screw you.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"So, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge?I-I don?'t want to answer any more purge questions.All right, hey, hey, that?'s cool.I can roll with that."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,My nana!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Huh?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,My nana! We have to save her!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,You just now remembered your Nana exists.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,I-I was traumatized.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Haven?'t you been through like 15 purges?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"I mean, some as a child? Will somebody just help me get her?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Fine, whatever. Morty, stay."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Get out! Get out!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Get the fuck out of the flying machine!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Oh, my God! O-okay! Okay!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Back up, asshole."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Back up.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Ohh.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Back the fuck up!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"For what it?'s worth, I?'m sorry, but that?'s not really worth anything tonight, is it?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Y-you can?'t leave us here. You?'re killing us! You hear me? Come back. Y-you got to come back. Change your mind. Oh, geez."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Morty! Aah! Fucking Amish bitch shot me!  She tried to purge me, Morty. You let your wiener do the walking, and now I?'m dead. Morty."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Rick, she took the car!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"You fucking kidding me, Morty?! She took my car and the gun. We?'re like the rest of these assholes now. W-w-we?'re gonna get purged, Morty. Help me up."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Oh, geez! Wait a minute, Rick. Why don?'t we just use your portal gun?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"It?'s in the car, dip-ass. Oh, God, it hurts."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty. It?'s the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it. I hope it was worth it."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I was just trying to do right.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yeah, well, that?'s not really the theme of tonight?'s party. Heads up. rapists. Well, don?'t just stand there, Morty. Purge 'em."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Me?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them? Pick up a stick or something and kill them."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Um, w-we come in peace."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, my God."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"There?'s more where that came from! You want to get purged, you bring it! Drop  drop your shit! Drop it all. Morty, go get their shit. Hurry up. I only had one of those things I threw. I?'m holding a box of tic tacs right now."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Want some crackers?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"No, thank you."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Are you ready to be nice to me?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,In exchange for crackers?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,What happened to you?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Dad, get a job.You?'re trying to create drama because you?'re bored. Oh.  It?'s the space phone grandpa gave us."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Hello?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Hey, Summer, it?'s grandpa. I need you to do me a favor."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,I can barely hear you. Who is it?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Morty and I are on a planet that?'s purging. I need you to take down-
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,A plan that?'s what?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"We?'re on a planet that?'s purging, Summer. Purging. We lost our car and my gun, and we?'re in a purge."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,"Ooh, is it Taddy Mason?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Like the movie "The Purge"?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yes, I-I need you to ta-"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,That movie sucked...
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, my God. Hold on."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,It?'s not Taddy Mason?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Dad, who the fuck is Taddy Mason"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,My friend.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Are you okay? I?'m putting you on speaker.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Taddy?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yes, Jerry, it?'s Taddy, a person no one?'s ever heard of until now, calling you on a space phone."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,I can?'t tell if you?'re being sarcastic.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,man with pitchfork,Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Reload, fast."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Summer, w-we need you to take down this number. Quit screwing around."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Morty? Are you all right?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,No!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Why are you with Taddy Mason?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Holy shit, Dad! Shut the fuck up!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Okay. I guess I?'m just this entire family?'s toilet paper.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Are you writing this down? Will you please write this down?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Yes, yes."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,7-7-1-9-8...  3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5. Aah!  You son of a bitch!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Morty, I don't want to be the ""a little help"" guy, but a little help?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Okay, I have a pen. Go."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"7-7-1-9-8-3- 6-4-2-1-1-2-5. A spoon, Morty? A spoon?!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I?'m sorry.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"There?'s a pile of silverware next to you, and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"All right, okay!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there?'s a red box with a keypad on it. You?'re gonna take that box outside, and you?'re gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad. Got it?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Got it.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,I?'m ignoring you.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse, I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package. Just remember, if there?'s people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"We?'re not purging anyone, Rick, all right? W-will you stop it?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Morty, if we?'re gonna survive tonight, you?'re gonna need to harness your repressed rage."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I don?'t have any!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Spoken like a person with repressed rage.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,"I take no part in the festival. If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"No such agenda, chief."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"We?'re not too keen on the purge, either, sir. We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth. It?'s a different planet."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"By the way, life on other planets exists. Don?'t let it distract you."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,I?'ll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending on the condition that you listen to my tale.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Deal.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"All right, I?'m gonna go to the roof and set things up. Morty, you listen to his tale."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Okay.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,"""Fade in. Exterior. Unnamed city. Day."" The hustle and bustle is a symphony of progress. We pan past windows, each of which contain a different story, to find Jacey Iakims, 28... hot, but doesn?'t know it. Jacey stops when her high heel gets caught in the grating of a sewer. Suddenly, a man steps into frame and points a gun at her... This is not her day. Fade to black. ""Title... ?'three weeks earlier.??"""
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,You really don?'t want to talk to me about this.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Dad, grandpa and Morty are in danger. You?'re unemployed, and you?'re bored. They?'re a higher priority."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Stop saying I?'m unemployed!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Okay, 7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-12... aah!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Good lord! Now what?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,"Look, I?'m your father, and I love you is all I?'m saying. I?'ll leave it at that."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Fine, dad!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Oh, he might have said to take it outside."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Come on, Summer. How hard is it to type some numbers into a box?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Device,Target locked.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, thank God. Well, I did my job. Summer did her job. Now all Morty has to do is finish listening to that tale."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,"Blane: ""Maybe I don?'t need a new friend."" Jacey: ""Maybe you?'re the only friend I need."" Blane: ""Need, or want?"" Jacey: ""I?'ve never been much for wanting."" Blane: ""Spoken like someone with needs."""
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Oh, geez."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,Hmm?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Uh, sorry. K-keep going."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,"""Jacey reaches out and touches his face."" It?'s clear he needs what she wants. She?'s a woman. He?'s a man. The city burns in the background as he takes her in his arms. Fade out. Title... ?'the end??...""Question mark."""
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Wow.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,Yeah?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,It?'s... G-good job. Good job.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,You liked it?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Of course I did.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,You didn?'t laugh at the scene in the bar.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"I...Thought it was funny, but I wanted to hear the rest."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,Do you have any thoughts? Notes?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"No. I-I just enjoyed it. That?'s my note, you know? Please write more."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,Seems a little insincere.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,What? No.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,You don?'t have to mollycoddle me. I want to improve my writing. Tell me your real thoughts.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"All right. Well, um, I?'m not a huge fan, personally, of the whole ""three weeks earlier"" teaser thing. I feel like, you know, we should start our stories where they begin not start them where they get interest..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,...get out
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Um, what?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,"No, I?'m sick of this. You bang on my door, you beg me to help you, I share something personal with you, and you take a giant shit on it."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,"Well, you can?'t. I want you out of here. You?'re a petty person, and you?'re insecure, and you?'re taking it out on me. That?'s a good script."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,What the hell?!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,I don?'t care. I want you out.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,What?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,Take that thing down. Your grandson is a shitty person. Leave now..
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Morty!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Rick, I didn?'t do anything. I sat through his entire screenplay..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,You "sat through it"?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Yes! Did you want me to weep with joy? It?'s terrible!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Whoa! Morty! We?'re guests here.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I tried to be a good guest! He dragged it out of me!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,I?'m taking down this beacon.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"No, stop! That?'s not fair! Just because you hate your own writing doesn?'t make me a bad person!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Lighthouse Keeper,Aah!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,You like that? You want me to cut to three weeks earlier when you were alive?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Whoa, Morty. You just purged."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Device,Beacon arriving.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Okay, time to go. Well, terrific."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Dad, what?'s going on? What?'s the deal here?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter. You?'re growing up so fast. You used to be my little girl.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,Yeah.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,"Remember when we used to go to the playground, and I?'d push you on the swings?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Oh, you could push me higher than all the other kids."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,You were so small and cute. I thought you were gonna fly right off into the street.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,I used to pee my pants.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,"I know, and now look at you! You have a job. You?'re making really good money. You?'re not paying any rent, so you have plenty of disposable income."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,"Oh, God, dad. Please, don?'t."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,I just need a few hundred dollars to get through the month. I have some interviews coming up. Something?'s gonna come through. I can feel it.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Summer,I?'m going inside.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,"I guess this is what rock bottom feels like, Jerry. Ow!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"It?'s okay, Morty. It?'s the purge, you know? Pushing old lighthouse keepers down the stairs is totally cool."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"It?'s not cool, Rick. I-I?'m not like these people. I can?'t run around chopping people?'s heads off one day a year and then sleep well the rest of the time."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Well, you better start getting used to it, little bitch, because we got some fucking company. Hey, there he is."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Old Guy,Here I am.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Morty. Time to  purge. Tony! Toni! Ton??!?'s "feels good" plays ] ? it feels good ?? yeah ?? it feels good ?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Geez. Wow, Morty. Now you?'re getting into it. Never expected that out of you. All right, uh, let?'s go find my ship."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Hey, hey, Morty, Morty. There it is down there... my ship. It looks to me like the... Morty?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Suck my dick.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Eat this!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Ooh, boy, you?'re really, uh...Ha-ha! Ha! ? It feels good you?'re really going for it over there, huh?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"I, uh  I think, uh  I think those people were just hiding."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I don?'t give a shit!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Okay, Morty, now you?'re just shooting corpses."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,How do you like this?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Okay, buddy. All right. That?'s good. Good job."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Time to go home.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Wait, stop! Please, don?'t kill me!I-I never intended to harm you, I swear. I am trying to end the festival."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,W-w-what do you mean?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,I was going to use your ship to destroy the rich assholes that run our society and save my people from the horrors of this yearly festival.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Fuck that, Rick! We got to kill her! Kill her! Kill her!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Whoa! Geez, Morty, purge it down a little."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"""Purge! Don?'t purge!"" You?'re sending me mixed messages, Rick."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Morty  you?'re acting like a  freaking lunatic. Calm down.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Screw you, Rick! I'll purge you, too, you old, rickety piece of crap! This has been a long time coming! I""m gonna rip your fucking guts out and smear them all over your face! I ain?'t taking no sh... aah!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Okay, s-sorry about that. Now, where are these rich people?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rich Asshole,"To another successful year of the festival, pitting poor people against each other for thousands of years."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rich Asshole,"Wait, w-where is that music coming from? What is the meaning of this?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Here's the deal. I?'m not here to judge. I?'m just a guy from another planet. But this girl is one of your poor people, and I guess you guys felt like it was okay to subject her to inhuman conditions because there was no chance of it ever hurting you. It?'s sort of the socio-political equivalent of, say, a suit of power armor around you. But now things are evened out, so, Arthricia?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Happy festival, cocksuckers! Suck my cock! Chew my balls. Suck my huge dick!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Geez.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"You want to get in on this, Rick?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"No, I really... honestly, I-I?'ve had my fill. It?'s gratuitous at this point."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,You sure you don?'t want to join in? This is really amazing.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"yeah, but... ah, all right. Fuck it."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"yeah, bitch, what?'s up?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Arthricia, what do you got?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,Check this move out.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Oh, ho!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"I don?'t know what song that is, but I fucking love it!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"""Feels Good"". It?'s a fucking hit song."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"topped the charts, I think."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Ho, ho!"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Hey, thanks for helping me, Rick. You?'re a pretty great guy."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Yeah, yeah. Fuck you for shooting my liver. I?'ll see you around."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Oh, man. What... what happened?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Don?'t worry about it, Morty. Listen, if you wanted to try to get a piece, you better hurry up. Now?'s your last chance."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Hey, hey, Arthricia, um, maybe I could... uh-"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,I have a boyfriend.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,Okay.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,I?'m not trying to be rude. I just... I don?'t want to lead you on.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,I-I-I understand.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"I mean, thank you so much for helping end the festival, but I have a boyfriend, and, uh, he?'s just..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Okay, okay, you can stop saying it! I took it okay the first time, and now you?'re just repeating stuff."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Oh, I?'m sorry."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,It?'s okay.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Arthricia,"Oh, you?'re so sweet, I just... oh, but I can?'t."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Yeah, you?'re still doing it."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,It won?'t be easy creating a new society from the ground up.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Well, a helpful rule might be if you need something, you get it. Pretty simple, right?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man with glasses,I need food.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Who?'s got food for that guy?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Large Man,"I do, but this is for me."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man with glasses,Can?'t you make some more?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Large Man,"Oh, sure. And while I?'m making food for everyone, who takes care of my kids?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,"I?'ll take care of your kids, if I get some extra food for it."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Large Man,Extra food?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,"Well, I?'m not gonna do extra work if we all get the same."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"All right, okay, fair is fair. If you do extra work, you get extra food."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,Oh.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Large Man,Who?'s gonna keep track of who gets how much food for how much work?
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,"Hello. I can do that. I?'ll keep track of everyone?'s food, you know, in exchange for food."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Large Man,That?'s not a real job!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,"Oh, and making food is?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Large Man,You son of a bitch!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man,Eat this!
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Man with glasses,"Guys, guys, guys, guys, whoa, whoa. Cool it, now. Take it easy. There?'s too much aggression here. What if we designate a period of time during which we can all get this hate, murder, and rage out of our system..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"I can?'t help but feel ashamed about what I did back there, Rick. I guess you were right. I?'ve got a lot of repressed stuff. I need to deal with."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,"Don?'t worry about it, Morty. Remember those candy bars earlier that we got in the first act?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Yeah, what about them?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Turns out they have a chemical in them called purgenol that amplifies all your violent tendencies.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Morty,"Oh, boy. Whew! Thank goodness for that, huh? That?'s a relief."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Rick,Yep. Don?'t even sweat. You?'re still the same old Morty. Your character?'s totally protected.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Announcer,And there's the approach.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Beth,"Jerry, what is ""Taddi Mason LLC,"" and why is our phone bill $700?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Uh...
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Taddi Mason,"Hey, are you bored..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Uh...
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Taddi Mason,"...lonely, just looking for a friend?"
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Taddi Mason,"Call me, Taddi Mason. It's only $1.99 a minute to talk."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Uh...
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Taddi Mason,"Sign up today, and I'll even call you on a regular basis..."
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Uh...
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Taddi Mason,...for just $1.99 a minute.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Jerry,Uh...
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Taddi Mason,That's a steal because I'm a great pal. We could talk about sports or barbecue.
2,Look Who's Purging Now,Beth,"Jerry, get a job."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You?'re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,Cool.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*points out the window* See that planet right there? Don?'t fly too close to that planet. Someone?'ll come out and try to wash your windshield.  Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. *hangs up* Alright Morty, lesson?'s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"Oh, you still use ?'south?? in space?"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*startled* WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,What are you talking about? We agreed a boy?'s father should be present when he?'s learning to drive.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"I guess I remember that. *rubs forehead* Wow. And you?'ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don?'t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,*chuckles* Cool! Looks like I?'m comin?? along for an adventure!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Yep.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,This is where we?'re going?
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Nope.  This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry-Sitter,Well look at this fella. *pinches Jerry?'s cheek* Aren?'t you handsome?
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Thank you! I?'m Jerry. *extends hand*
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry-Sitter,"*as if speaking to a child* Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"I?'m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming?"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry-Sitter,"Oh, they?'ll be back soon."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,What?
2,Mortynight Run,Pajama Jerry,I don?'t know how this works!
2,Mortynight Run,Underpants Jerry,Help me!
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,What the hell?
2,Mortynight Run,Pajama Jerry,"I know, right?"
2,Mortynight Run,Tuxedo Jerry,"*enters room* Oh, what the hell?"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"I know, right?"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,*looking at a pamphlet* Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well?? I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy?'s rich."
2,Mortynight Run,Receptionist,Don?'t forget to check the reason for your drop-off.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*checks off ?'stowaway?? and ??Annoying me??* Trust me Morty, I?'ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don?'t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn?'t be safer."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number?'s your dad. If you lose it, we?'re not gonna be able to get him back."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Okay, wait here."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,I wanna come with.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Don?'t come with. It?'s boring, it?'s *burps* business stuff."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th??in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ?'em in cocaine, and they wipe ?'em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn?'t shady."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Ah, crap. *rolls down window* Hey, what?'s up?"
2,Mortynight Run,Krombopulos Michael,"Hey, Rick! Haha! Here you go, three thousand Flurbos! D??you have the weapon?"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Can?? Can we please??? This is my grandson, Morty."
2,Mortynight Run,Krombopulos Michael,Well hi Morty! I?'m Krombopulos Michael! I?'m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away."
2,Mortynight Run,Krombopulos Michael,"*examines weapon* Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots antimatter? My target can?'t be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty! Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered, *passes Morty his card* please give me a call. I?'m very discrete??"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Y-Y-Y-You?'re gonna give him your card?!
2,Mortynight Run,Krombopulos Michael,"I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn?'t matter. I just love killin??!"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,??You sell weapons to killers for money?
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Ugh?? You?'ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It?'s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Uh, what?"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Aw, this place is the best. It?'s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty?'s head* Here, check this out."
2,Mortynight Run,Roy,Ah!
2,Mortynight Run,Roy?'s mother,"Roy, what?'s wrong?"
2,Mortynight Run,Roy,I??had a nightmare. I was with an old man?? He put a helmet on me.
2,Mortynight Run,Roy?'s mother,"It?'s just a fever. Get some sleep, I don?'t want you missing school on Monday. *walks out of the room and switches off the lights*"
2,Mortynight Run,Teacher,I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future.  Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.
2,Mortynight Run,Announcer,"Spiraling perfectly, it?'s gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20!  Now he?'s at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy the Rocket! Touchdown!"
2,Mortynight Run,Roy?'s wife,I just think it?'s time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy?
2,Mortynight Run,Doctor,"Had we caught it sooner?? Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What?'s important is that we move quickly."
2,Mortynight Run,Roy,I?'m not?'ready to die??
2,Mortynight Run,Roy?'s wife,*takes his hand* You?'re not going to.
2,Mortynight Run,Customer,"Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy."
2,Mortynight Run,Voice,"*shouting from off screen* Hey Roy, you pull those Persian off-white shags for the clearance sale?"
2,Mortynight Run,Roy,Whoa. Sh-shit! Shit!
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,Whoa! What the hell?! Wha??Where am I?! What the hell?!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"*looks around, grips his head* W?? Where?'s my wife?"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Morty. You were just playing a game. It?'s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"I?'m Morty?? You?'re Rick?? Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Don?'t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"It?'s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there?'s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That?'s why he does it for a living? Now if you?'ll excuse me, it?'s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Uh-huh, yeah, that?'s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store."
2,Mortynight Run,Alien,"*passing by, sees Rick playing Roy* Holy shit! This guy?'s taking Roy off the grid!  This guy doesn?'t have a social security number for Roy!"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"Hi, I?'m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I?'m an adult and would like to go home, please."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry-Sitter,Well of course! Right through that tube. *points to a tube in the wall*
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,*muttering to self* Unbelievable. *approaches the tube and starts climbing in*
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry-Sitter,You?'re doing great!
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"*indignantly* I know how to crawl in a tube. *to himself, while crawling* Ugh?? Come on?? This is harder than it looks??  Whoooooaaaa!"
2,Mortynight Run,Pink-shirt Jerry,Marco?  Marco?
2,Mortynight Run,Other Jerry,Come find me.
2,Mortynight Run,Pink-shirt Jerry,Marco?
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,You guys are enjoying this? Don?'t you feel a little?? patronized?
2,Mortynight Run,Pink-shirt Jerry,How so?
2,Mortynight Run,Daycare Beth,Jerry!
2,Mortynight Run,Other Jerry,Beeeth.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!"
2,Mortynight Run,Daycare Beth,"I love you, Jerry!"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Aw?? Beth??
2,Mortynight Run,Daycare Beth,Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director?'s commentary on?
2,Mortynight Run,Jerrys,Oh! Yes! Definitely!
2,Mortynight Run,Daycare Beth,First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,The factory tint setting is always too high! *climbs out of the ballpit and hurries after ??Beth?? with the other Jerrys*
2,Mortynight Run,Other Jerry,Out of my way!
2,Mortynight Run,Another Jerry,The factory tint setting is always too high!
2,Mortynight Run,Krombopulos Michael,"Oh boy, here I go killin?? again!"
2,Mortynight Run,Ship,You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"*dazed* All out of off-white Persians?? *gets out of the ship and realizes he killed Krombopulos Michael* Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! *picks up KM?'s arm and the antimatter gun*"
2,Mortynight Run,Gromflomite,Drop the gun!
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,You don?'t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!
2,Mortynight Run,Gromflomite,I guess that makes two of us. *fires up his weapon*
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don?'t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don?'t get along!"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,You saved my life!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,What?
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael?'s target? W-Wwwwhat?'s your name?
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call ??Jessica?'s feet.?? No, ?'telepathy.??"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"I like this name, ??Fart.?? Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Morty, don?'t do it.  Morty??  Morty, you idiot!"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Oh crap, let?'s get you outta here!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"We can?'t get him outta here. He?'s gaseous. He?'s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"*stomps past Rick* Well then I guess we?'re all getting in the car! Right, uh??"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,Fart.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don?'t wanna deal with this!"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Y-You?'ve been clear on the fact that you don?'t wanna help, so just go away!"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,More are coming.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Screw this. I?'m out.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Oooh??! Come on, come on!"
2,Mortynight Run,Gromflomite,Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire!
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,*still trying to start the car* Oh no no no!
2,Mortynight Run,Gromflomite,Open fire!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! *shoves Morty out of the driver?'s seat and takes the wheel* Move!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,More are coming.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,Rick!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Yeah, yeah."
2,Mortynight Run,Gearhead,Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"That?'s ??cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact."
2,Mortynight Run,Gearhead,"Actually, it?'s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they?'re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire??"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*interrupts him* So I?'ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don?'t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we?'re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home."
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"You do understand I?'m telepathic, right?"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,I?'m being polite.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Rick, we?'re taking him back where he belongs!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Yeah, where?'s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call ??get out of my head, Fart, I know you?'re in here, la la la la???? No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch??"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,That?'s how things should be. It?'s how they could be.
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,I could not agree more.
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. / The ground can be space  / With feet marching toward a peaceful sky. / All the moonmen want things their way / But we make sure they see the sun. / Goodbye, moonmen / You say goodbye, moonmen. / Goodby??"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*holding a golf club* Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn?'t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!"
2,Mortynight Run,Random Jerry,"*opens email and laughs* Duck, duck, birdie?  Very funny!"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Here comes another funny??
2,Mortynight Run,Other Jerry,"Hahaha! Oh, this place is great."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,I almost wish I could stay longer than one day.
2,Mortynight Run,Other Jerry,*suddenly serious* You just might.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,W-What do you mean?
2,Mortynight Run,Other Jerry,These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back.  ?'they live here now.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Uuuum??
2,Mortynight Run,Gear Anchor,No gear turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives  reportedly at large somewhere within the Gear System.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Son of a?? *approaches Fart* Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"I am no more valuable than life itself. However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this.  That was oxygen. I added seventy-one protons to it."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*picks up the gold* Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin?? for us! *pockets gold* Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that?'s gonna be to my work?"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead?? *turns around*
2,Mortynight Run,Gearhead,"*pointing a gun at Rick* I?'m sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you gotta look out for Number One."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Number One is me, asshole! You?'re supposed to be my friend!"
2,Mortynight Run,Gearhead,Friend? Do you even know my real name? It?'s Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire species of gear people. Calling me ??Gearhead?? is like calling a Chinese person ??Asia-face.??
2,Mortynight Run,Gearhead,"No, not twigs!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it?'s time to go."
2,Mortynight Run,Gear Policeman #1,Nobody move!
2,Mortynight Run,Gear Policeman #2,Oh my god.
2,Mortynight Run,Gear Policeman #1,Are those???
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"I did the right thing, Rick!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Tell that to Gearhead?'s gearsticles.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,You did that!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Wrong! I?'d be playin?? Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"*playing poker with other Jerrys, sighs* I can?'t believe Rick did this. This is the eighth to the last straw."
2,Mortynight Run,Bearded Jerry,Ante up.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,You know what? *throws down cards* Screw it! I have a better gamble for your guys. *leans forward* I say we escape.
2,Mortynight Run,Bearded Jerry,"If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door."
2,Mortynight Run,Tank-top Jerry,You think we?'re kept here against our will? That would be illegal.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"But?? If you can leave, then why are you still here?"
2,Mortynight Run,Buzzcut Jerry,Same reason as you. *looks to other Jerrys for confirmation* ??We?'re Jerrys.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,I?'m leaving.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry-Sitter,"Okay then, that was always allowed."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Morty, take the wheel!"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Whoa, whoa!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Whoa!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?! *laughs* Haha, I?'m kidding, I know that?'s on me."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"Um, Rick!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Shit. Well, I guess this is it."
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"Morty, crack the window."
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.
2,Mortynight Run,Officer,"Well?? He?'d probably like to have me to himself, that?'s how friends are."
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,Or does he want her to himself?
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes.
2,Mortynight Run,Officer,*anguished* My life is a fucking joke.
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"Goodbye, moonmen. / You say, goodbye, moonmen."
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"Goodbye, moonmen??  Alright, let?'s proceed."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Damn. Can?'t blame that on the dog. ?'talk about silent but deadly. I-I?'ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I?'m sayin???"
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,*not amused* Are you done?
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"I?'ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don?'t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like??if I said Gasablanca! ??Alright, I?'m done.  Let?'s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin?? a life!"
2,Mortynight Run,Garblovian,Ga-ga blahg blahg?
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"Um?? Earth, please?"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Um?? Is this?? Do I pay?
2,Mortynight Run,Garblovian,Agah blahg-blah!
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Sorry!
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"Hmm. Hmm?? *hesitantly makes to pet the creature, but its face suddenly splays out in a tentacle formation* Agh! *runs away*"
2,Mortynight Run,Garblovian,Agah blahg blahg?
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,I don?'t??
2,Mortynight Run,Garblovian,*angrily* Agah blahg!
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,What do you want?
2,Mortynight Run,Garblovian,*holds out cup* Agah blahg blah??
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Oh! *looks at self and begins panicking* Ahahaaaahhhhh??.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,*wiping goo off himself* Uhhh?? Huhhh??.  Oooh! *runs away*
2,Mortynight Run,Tank-top Jerry,"Hey, are you the one that left?"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,*single nod*
2,Mortynight Run,Tank-top Jerry,I get it. It?'s?? uh?? a hassle out there.
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,*suddenly less forlorn* Right? Who needs that?
2,Mortynight Run,Other Jerrys,*to one another* Right? Not me.
2,Mortynight Run,Paul,"Oh-ho, not us!"
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,Uh?? Who are you?
2,Mortynight Run,Paul,"Oh, excuse me. Paul Fleishman. *shakes Jerry?'s hand* Infinite timelines! In some of them Beth remarries."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,??Geez??
2,Mortynight Run,Paul,"Don?'t worry. I treat Beth very well, and I do not overstep my bounds with Morty. Every kid needs a dad, but there?'s no replacing you. Hey, you wanna give us a hand with this? *gestures to the TV* We?'re trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the TV. I-I-I don?'t??It?'s very difficult."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"Oh. Uh, well, is there an Aux input?"
2,Mortynight Run,Tank-top Jerry,"I tried that, but there?'s two different colors."
2,Mortynight Run,Various Jerrys,Uh?? There?'s two different colors.
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,The wormhole is seventy of what you call ?'meters?? what you call ??north?? of what you call ??here.??
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I?'m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.  That?'s my new word for ?'shit?? because of today?'s events."
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,Here it is. This should take me back to my kind.
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"I?'m gonna miss you, um, Fart. I?'m really sorry your name became Fart."
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"I will be back soon, Morty."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,*excited* Really?
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,Um?? Cleansing???
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life. To us, you are what you would call a disease. Wherever we discover you, we cure it. You said yourself that life must be protected even through sacrifice.  You haven?'t changed your mind about that. I can sense your thoughts. Morty."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,*wipes his eyes* Um?? Before you go?? Could you sing a?? C-Could you sing for me again?
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,"Yes, Morty. *approaches him as ??Goodbye Moonmen?? begins, again set to a sequence formed from Morty?'s imagination* Cosmos without hatred / Blinding stars of cosmic light / Quasars shine through endless night / And everything is one in the beauty / And now we say goodby??"
2,Mortynight Run,Fart,Morty?? Why?? Why?
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,Goodbye.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?  Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin?? that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn?'t for nothin??, you know? *notices Morty?'s detached, almost anguished expression* You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I?'ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they?'re all coming to visit."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"*panicking* What?! Rick! No, you can?'t!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Too late, Morty. The hole?'s opening."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,"No, no, Rick! You don?'t understand!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Th-there?'s a lot more where that came from too.
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Hey. *taps another Rick?'s arm* Hey bro. How many people was your Morty responsible for killing today?
2,Mortynight Run,Other Rick,"None, we chilled at Blips and Chitz all day, ain?'t that right homie?"
2,Mortynight Run,Other Morty,Darn right bro! Roy rules!
2,Mortynight Run,Other Rick,Haha!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"*glares at Morty* Must be nice?? Hey, Morty, there?'s our Jerry."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,"Mm, I missed you. Hey, Rick."
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,Glad you?'re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?
2,Mortynight Run,Jerry,I?'d like that.
2,Mortynight Run,Another Rick,"*holding a ticket* Hey, wait, do you have 5126?"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Uh, I?'m not sure. Morty."
2,Mortynight Run,Other Rick,"Uh, that?'s a Blips and Chitz ticket."
2,Mortynight Run,Morty,What?!
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever."
2,Mortynight Run,Jerrys,"Uh?? W-wait, what?"
2,Mortynight Run,Ricks,"Alright, come on, Jerry."
2,Mortynight Run,Announcer,"Are you tired of the same daily droll? Well, get on over to Blips and Chitz!  We got, uh?? one game! We got a whole bunch of games here! Uh, we got chabos and flobos and you can shoot things! Get on over here and play the games! Use your Flurbos to get tickets! Roy 2 just got here! G-Get over here at Ch?? Chips and Chitz!"
2,Mortynight Run,Rick,"It?'s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a Ball Fondlers movie franchise."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,I can't believe the things this reality considers PG-13
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Yeah, I'm pretty jealous."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Don't be Morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,Shut up! Morty: W-whoa!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,We're gonna go get some ice-cream motherfuckers!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Oh great.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Oh boy. W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Uhm. Go inside what?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"The battery Morty. Be right back Summer stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,Wait! You can't leave me here!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Keep. Summer. Safe.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"Egh, wonderful."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Man,"Hey, excuse me, hello?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,Uhmm...
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Man,What you think you're better than me? Nobody's better than me! Ey! ey!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,Agh! Aghaaaa!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Keep. Summer. Safe.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Thinner Man,"Hey man, what the hell! That was my daughter's paediatrician! Uagha!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"No! Stop, don't kill him!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Confirmed.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Thinner Man,Uaghuu. Ugh. Uh. Oh God! I can't feel my legs! Help! He-elp!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Summer is safe.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,I don't feel safe.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Confirmed.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Thinner Man,Oh God help me! Help me! help me please! You can help me.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Oh man. Where are we Rick?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Morty, remember eight seconds ago when  when you said, ""Go inside what?"" And I said, ""The battery""? And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, ""Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty. What a perplexing mystery this is."""
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it. You don't have to bust my balls."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Huh, this isn't right. This pipe's supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Instead we've got... zero? Now what are these people doing?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"W-w-w-whoa, people?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"It's time for some hands-on engine repair.All right, Morty, hold on to something."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Whoa! Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Anchor,"It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we're aliens."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,What? Why?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Obviously  you really  know nothing about car repair.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Greetings!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means ""Peace among worlds."" How hilarious is that?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,"Rick, our alien friend."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,"That's correct.  We've evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,I would love to see it.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,Fuck you.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,What did you say to me?!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,"""Fuck you."" Y-you told me it means ""much obliged""."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,"No, no, no. Blow me."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,"Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it's your ass. Chris, I'm in the middle of something."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,"Zeep, is Rick-- The alien."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Rick the alien. Rick the alien...
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,I dropped out of school. It's not a place for smart people.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Ohhhh, snap!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Listen to me, you arrogant little--"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,"R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"Fine. It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Dumb  name.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Excuse me?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,This isn't a fucking chocolate factory. I don't have time.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr.President,Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let's go."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Whoa-oh!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical. It's not cool."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,What?!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away  making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then--"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Rick, a word? What the hell was that?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,I know. "Eek barba dirkle"? That's a pretty fucked up "ooh-la-la".
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that motherfucking ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Wh-wh-why are you making that face?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Holy shit!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,It's me. I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"You don't think that's overdoing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind. You know what? I shouldn't be so critical. I'm an alien."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"Places, please. We're about to land."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Too fast.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Law enforcement converging on location. Keep Summer safe.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Confirm custom defense protocol-- Keep Summer safe-- No physical force.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,Yes.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Processing.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Scanning assailants.  Psychological option detected.  Gestating.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"""Gestating""?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,"Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,Incoming!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 2,We got a device!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,Bomb! Bomb!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kid,Daddy?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,"Oh, my God.  Hunter?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kid,Daddy?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,What the hell?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,"Jesus Christ, cease fire! Stay back! H-h-hunter?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kid,Daddy.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,"Hunter!  Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter. Oh, my boy. My boy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault. I'm sorry."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kid,"Daddy, leave the car alone."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,W-w-w-what?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kid,Leave the car alone.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,Hunter?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,Don't--
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"Oh, my God."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Swat Officer 1,"Stay here, Hunter! No!  God, no! Hunter!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,All of you have loved ones. All can be returned. All can be taken away. Please step away from the vehicle. Keep Summer safe.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Hey, uh, let me ask you something."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Teenyverse President,Yes?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Teenyverse President,All of them. That's their job.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Teenyverse President,How do you know about that? It's top secret.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough.  Crank it. I told them this means "Peace among worlds". How hilarious is that?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Re-really funny, Zeep."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kyle,"It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank. But what they won't know is--"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"You'll be taking most of their energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,It's show  time.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong. You're basically-- This is slavery. You're talking about creating a planet of slaves."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Told you, Zeep."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kyle,"Oh, they won't be slaves. They'll work for each other and pay each other money."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,That just sounds like slavery with ex... tra... steps.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,What?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Wait a minute. Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Microverse!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kyle,"Uh, teenyverse."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Ugh! You bastard!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Much obliged.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kyle,What the hell is happening?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"This is healthy, trust me."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"You're my battery, motherfucker.  That's all you are. I made you. Your microverse sucks! And your miniverse is the size of a fucking lobster tank! It's whack!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kyle,Are they not really aliens?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Kyle,"So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe. And that guy made a universe. And that's the universe where I was born. Where my father died. Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,I made you!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard. Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,"Rick, Zeep",Teenyverse.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Come on, come on, come on."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Pterodactyl!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"Asshole! When I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,That's what you used my universe for? To run your car?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you fucking cocksucker! What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,You crafty son of a--
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,I didn't ask to be born!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"All right, that's it! I'm out. I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,"Go, go, go!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,"I am unable to destroy this army. To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, but you will not permit it."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,Correct.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Confirmed. I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters. But I do want to say you are not making this easy.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"You know you're kind of a dick, right?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,"My function is to keep Summer safe, not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe and stuff. That's you. That's how you talk."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Hey, that's my deer!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Aaaaaaah!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Raah!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,I hope your God is as big a dick as you.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,My God's the biggest dick that's never existed. Why do you think I'm even here?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,You're here because you created someone smarter than you.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Kalo kada sha la.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Holy shit. Morty? I haven't seen you in months. You're leading the tree people? Huh. That's a step up.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Ooh. Wow. Gaaaaay.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,That is pretty gay.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop. I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Look, I don't care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bullshit, and you're working together to get us back home."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"No can do, Morty. I just can't."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,I just don't see how I can--
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart. You'll figure it out.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,"You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship! 10, 9..."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"All right, not bad."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,I guess you're an okay proto recombinator.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"If this works, drinks are on me."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower. I'm an alcoholic."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Opium addict.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up. You guys are the fucking worst! Your gods are a lie! Fuck you, fuck nature, and fuck trees!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Yes! You did it! Yes!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Hey, uh, how about that drink?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Is our wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with?"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,It's cool. I'll be back in a sec.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,You know how long a second can take in a microverse?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Morty, hop on my back."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Why?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Go, go  Sanchez ski shoes."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Aaaaaah!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,...Eight...
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Aaaah!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Oof!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Hold still.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr. President,"Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Aaaah! Holy--
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,You monster!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Mr. President,Whoa. Bad tour.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,...seven...
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Secretary,"Hey, you got to sign out."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Secretary,"If that were really true, then..."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Female Visitor,I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Secretary,Third floor. Would you like to go to dinner with--
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Female Visitor,"Uh, no."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,What?!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Oh, my God!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Concentrate, Morty. Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,...six...
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Hey, Zeep."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Huh?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Aaah!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"We did it, Morty. Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Taxi Driver,Excuse me?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,...five--
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Soldier,Sir?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,Holy hell.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Soldier,Sir!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Human President,Hold you fire!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,What's going on?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Human President,"Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace. We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption. Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Soldier,What do we do about the space car?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Human President,"Leave it alone. I mean, what did it really do, anyways? Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy?  Not a bad trade for spider peace."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Army General,".All right, that's it. Move out!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Spider,What wicked webs we un-weave.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Human President,I love this spider!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ship,Summer is safe.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,"All right, I get it."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Rick!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Don't do it.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"You quit school, but you still got some learning to do."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,Aah!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Unh!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Class dismissed.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Geez.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,You all right?
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,Uh-huh!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,"Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Of course you don't. But Zeep did. He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Zeep,"Peace among worlds, Rick."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Jesus.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Yeah. Listen to that baby purr. You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys. All right, here we go."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Thank y-o-o-ou. See, Morty? This is what it's all about.This is why we do what we do."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Morty,Uh-huh.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream.
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Ice cream clerk,"Presidential decree-- All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs."
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"What the fuck did you do, Summer?!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,It was your ship! Your stupid ship did it!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,Don't blame my ship!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,It melted a child!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,My ship doesn't do anything...
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,It killed it itself!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,...unless it's told to do something!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Summer,We almost died!
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"I don't want to hear it, Summer!"
2,The Ricks Must Be Crazy,Rick,"Your boobs are all hanging about, and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out. And don't even try to deny it, either."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Steve, I just got a weird e-mail. Did you buy us airline tickets?"
2,Total Rickall,Uncle Steve,"Aw shoot, it was supposed to be a surprise! I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I'm treating the family to a vacation!"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Steve, you're so sweet!"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,Thanks Uncle Steve!
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Best uncle ever!
2,Total Rickall,Uncle Steve,"Look out world, the Smith family is goin' to Paris!"
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Yeah! Awesome!
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"I, you know what, I-"
2,Total Rickall,Uncle Steve,You're gonna land on your feet Jer. Some company out there's gonna thank they're lucky stars they hired my little brother.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Who the fuck are you?
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"My goofy brother Steve. He's been living here almost a year now, are you losing your mind?"
2,Total Rickall,Uncle Steve,Hey someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks am I right?
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"What the hell, Rick? What the hell?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an "Uncle Steve." That is an alien parasite.
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,But I've known him my whole life!
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"No, you haven't Jerry.  These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting."
2,Total Rickall,Morty,Steve wasn't real?
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit."
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Someone?
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet."
2,Total Rickall,Morty,But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"No, ""Steve"" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up."
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Ooh wee, whatever you want Rick! We're here to help!"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer."
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,Maybe you got the first one in time Rick!
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Can't afford to chance it.
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Dad, why does our house have blast shields?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Trust me, Beth, you don't wanna know how many answers that question has."
2,Total Rickall,Mr Poopybutthole,"Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y-- remember that? After the Hulk musical?"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the Hulk. I just got that."
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose."
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine. I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be."
2,Total Rickall,Nicky,Somebody call for repairs?
2,Total Rickall,All,Yay! Cousin Nicky!
2,Total Rickall,Nicky,"It's me, Cousin Nicky. I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not. I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here!"
2,Total Rickall,Nicky,"It's true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let's get some fresh air."
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things."
2,Total Rickall,Nicky,"I hear you, Morty. Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin' -- ""we're walkin' here!"""
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,Nicky!
2,Total Rickall,Nicky,Oh!
2,Total Rickall,Morty,What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,But how did you know it was Nicky?
2,Total Rickall,Rick,I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.
2,Total Rickall,Beth,So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine. Did that not even happen?
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Well, of course it happened."
2,Total Rickall,Nazi,"Now that I possess the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich!"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick."
2,Total Rickall,Nicky,"Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal."
2,Total Rickall,Nazi,"I'm comfortable being called a Nazi. You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings?  Yeah. Think before you talk shit. Rah-gubaba, help me kill America!"
2,Total Rickall,All,Mr. Beauregard!
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,"After due consideration, I have elected not to retire."
2,Total Rickall,All,"Yeah! Oh, thank god!"
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,"Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty's high school."
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,"Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler.  dare to dream."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Wait.
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,No! Don't flashback!
2,Total Rickall,Summer,You're just gonna make more swelling.
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Don't worry, Jerry. Just relax. We called the fire department."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,You know they won't come here anymore.
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,Marmalade is served.
2,Total Rickall,Frankenstein,I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Take that!
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,We're trying to sleep.
2,Total Rickall,Morty,I don't want to go to the dance alone.
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,"Then perhaps, you shouldn't."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,Aww. Mr. Beauregard.
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,"Shall we, master Morty?"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,We shall.
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Oh, wait, don't leave without letting Photography Raptor take a picture."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,But there's always been 10.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites."
2,Total Rickall,Frankenstein,"You sure about that, Rick?"
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,"Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"All right, there's six of us,  and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Uh, dad, that's like 10 people."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?"
2,Total Rickall,Pencilvester,"Right here, Rick! Use me!"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!  Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that."
2,Total Rickall,Pencilvester,"Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these?"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"That's it. Photos. Hard evidence.  You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole."
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine."
2,Total Rickall,Summer,All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school.  What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're Mormon or dying.
2,Total Rickall,Frankenstein,I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen.
2,Total Rickall,Tinkles,Summer!
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Tinkles! It's past my bedtime.
2,Total Rickall,Tinkles,Not in never past bedtime land! Here we go!
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
2,Total Rickall,Gary,"Summer, we're trying to sleep."
2,Total Rickall,Summer,It was Tinkles! Tinkes?
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"That is su--  -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to ?C"
2,Total Rickall,Tinkles,"Hi, everybody. I'm Tinkles, and these are my friends."
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"See, everyone? Tinkles is real. That means so am I."
2,Total Rickall,Frankenstein,I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the Smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend."
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,"Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl."
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Aah! Grandpa Rick!
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Hold still, ""Summer."""
2,Total Rickall,Gary,"Rick, that is my daughter."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you."
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,"Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you?"
2,Total Rickall,Hamurai,"Rick, you love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai!"
2,Total Rickall,Amish Cyborg,"Remember it, Rick?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan?"
2,Total Rickall,All,Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing."
2,Total Rickall,Pencilvester,"You're good at it, Rick."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Watch me, baby. I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, ""Cuisine"" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like Tom Cruise from ""Cuisine.""  Yeah. Is that what it's called? ""Cuisine""?"
2,Total Rickall,Pencilvester,"Wow! Hey, everybody. Let's give it up for the grill master, Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick!"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Wait.  Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages.
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields?
2,Total Rickall,All,Yeah.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out."
2,Total Rickall,Pencilvester,"But Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition ""Zelda"" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that."
2,Total Rickall,Pencilvester,"Don't overreact, Rick."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Sleepy Gary, a word?"
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,"Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He's actually Frankenstein's monster."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Sleepy Gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then..."
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,"Jerry, just say it."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real?"
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,"Jesus, Jerry. No, you're real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry. Remember our vacation?"
2,Total Rickall,Gary,They're filming that new Star Wars movie down the coast. Should we check it out?
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,Sure. Why not?
2,Total Rickall,Gary,Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,I'd like that.
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,What are we doing?
2,Total Rickall,Gerry,I don't give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this.
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house."
2,Total Rickall,Frankenstein,"That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Uh, no thank --  Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?"
2,Total Rickall,Frankenstein,"Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?"
2,Total Rickall,Frankenstein,Shi-i-i-i-t. I'mma bust a --
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein!  Give it back!"
2,Total Rickall,All,Yeah!  Frankenstein!
2,Total Rickall,Rick,Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!
2,Total Rickall,Reverse Giraffe,"Maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real. You know me. I'm Reverse Giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with Hamurai."
2,Total Rickall,Hamurai,Hai!
2,Total Rickall,Reverse Giraffe,I saved Ghost In A Jar's life in Vietnam.
2,Total Rickall,Ghost in a Jar,Boo rah!
2,Total Rickall,Reverse Giraffe,"And Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on?"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,Too many.
2,Total Rickall,Reverse Giraffe,"Okay, so maybe we're just all fake."
2,Total Rickall,Mrs. Refrigerator,That don't make no sense!
2,Total Rickall,Reverse,"Giraffe: Or maybe, there's only one deceiver here -- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!"
2,Total Rickall,Reverse Giraffe,"I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls!  yeah! Say that all the time."
2,Total Rickall,All,That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there.
2,Total Rickall,Beth,And don't forget his incredibly vague back story.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Beth, I'm your father!"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Oh, are you, dad? Are you?"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?"
2,Total Rickall,Mrs. Refrigerator,In your face!
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"Give me the gun.  I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage.  All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too."
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"Oh -- oh, yeah?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, motherfucker! Pull the fucking trigger!"
2,Total Rickall,Duck with Muscles,"Oh, wow. Baby Wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,What the hell?
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Holy crap, Morty, you're right."
2,Total Rickall,Morty,Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate."
2,Total Rickall,Morty,Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?
2,Total Rickall,Mrs Refrigerator,"I-I-I-I -- everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time?  Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, Mrs. Refrigerator. They're thrilling. And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life."
2,Total Rickall,Mrs Refrigerator,"The jig is up!  get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah!   Oh, shit!"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?"
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Why am I always your go-to?
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Never go in my room again.
2,Total Rickall,Morty,I didn't!
2,Total Rickall,Morty,She's real. She's my bitch of a sister.
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Nice.
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"Mom, are you driving me to --"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?"
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"Oh, my god. Are you drunk?"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"What're you, my life coach?"
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Your what?
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh! God! Mom!"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Sweetheart, are you okay? I didn't mean to --"
2,Total Rickall,Summer,I'm gonna have a bruise! It's picture day!
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"It's not, don't overreact. I can clean it up."
2,Total Rickall,Summer,I want the police to take me!
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Thank you, sweetie."
2,Total Rickall,Cross Teddy Bear,"Beth, Beth, please!"
2,Total Rickall,Beth,I thought it was too good to be true that we'd have compatible kidneys.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything."
2,Total Rickall,Pencilvester,"Rick, I'm Pencilvester. Listen to that name. You can't kill me."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,You're right.  Kill Pencilvester.
2,Total Rickall,Tinkles,"Summer, I've always loved you!"
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Yep.
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"Oh, my god!"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,I-I-I thought you went to a concert!
2,Total Rickall,Summer,We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?!
2,Total Rickall,Morty,I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me!
2,Total Rickall,Summer,You're not the victim here!
2,Total Rickall,Morty,"I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace!"
2,Total Rickall,Summer,Aaaaaah!
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Beauregard,Ah. Master Rick. Remember when you weren't going to shoot me?
2,Total Rickall,Rick,I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?
2,Total Rickall,Ghost in a Jar,"Oh, I-I get it. It's a play on ""the butler did it."""
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary."
2,Total Rickall,Sleepy Gary,"Don't worry. I have a plan. If we can get to my boat, there's a --"
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,No. No! Send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary.
2,Total Rickall,Beth,Whoa. What the hell?
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,Look out for that homeless guy!
2,Total Rickall,Beth,Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,There isn't time! Just run!
2,Total Rickall,Beth,Get out here and help me!
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,They say you shouldn't do that! Just run!
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Ugh. Sorry, Jerry. You're real."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,I'm a parasite!
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Yeah, but you're real."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"Me, too."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone."
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,This is depressing. We killed every good person in the house. We're what's left? What a family.
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Rikki tikki tavi!"
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Ooh, whee! Amen to that. Now, this little poopypants is hungry. Will somebody pass me a pork chop?"
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Huh. I-is -- is something wrong, Beth?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"No, Beth!"
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Oh, fuck."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Wait, but I --"
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Oh, Beth! Why?!"
2,Total Rickall,Jerry,"I need an ambulance! There's been a shooting. My wife shot... Uh, my -- my wife shot a long-time family friend."
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,Why?
2,Total Rickall,Summer,"Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,I-I thought --
2,Total Rickall,Morty,Keep breathing!
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Oh, god. What's happening?"
2,Total Rickall,Morty,Look at me! Look at me! Don't -- don't fall asleep!
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Is -- is this what bleeding to death is? Oh, whee. Is this how I die?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Oh, geez! Oh, my god!"
2,Total Rickall,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Why would you do this? Beth. It's not supposed to hurt. I-I thought...  Ooh, whee."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Oh, he -- he's looking a lot better."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,"Is, um, is he mad at me?"
2,Total Rickall,Rick,"He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the ""you shot me"" equivalent of not being mad."
2,Total Rickall,Beth,Can he have visitors?
2,Total Rickall,Doctor,"He'd like to be alone. He told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him? If you love him, you should leave."
2,Total Rickall,Rick,And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,What? What kind of monster are you?
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,A competent one.
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Wait a minute, what?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,And away we go!
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Shhh, Morty!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Hi, dad."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Summer, Morty, are you okay?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,W-We just missed you a lot.
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why dowhy dowhywhy don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts."
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Oh!
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Uh oh.
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Phew...
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on.  Oh you agree, huh?  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?  Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep."
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"God, I feel terrible."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-"
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Uh, what? It was your job, Morty."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Nuh uh!
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,Yeah huh!
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man."
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,You shut up you big... female asshole!
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,I didn't!
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,You didn't what?
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,What's yours?
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,You shut up!
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,What do you mean?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Wait, what am I saying?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,Oh man... I don't feel good.
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,Am I me? I think so.
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,A-am I talking right now?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Wait, who said that?"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something."
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,What should we do Morty?
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,Let's see if he needs help.
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,What do you mean you're gonna help him.
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,"Ugh, I can help too."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,What's happening Grampa?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,What do you mean?
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,What? In English?
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,What? English please?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,But I thought there were infinite timelines.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Oh, my God!"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Are those cats?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"I assume they're Schrodinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Mom and Dad? Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage.
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Holy shit! What happened?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,W-what?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,This is Rum Raisin!
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,It's still alive.
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or--"
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"It's not an armadillo, asshole!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-"
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,So...
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Well don't different animals-
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Require different levels of skill to keep alive?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Oh God...
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Get the deer in the car, Jerry."
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Yes Beth.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.Morty 1"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be is."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,Or...
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,Or?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,We isn't
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Huh, what do you know, it's working"
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,"Ow, ow ouch!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,"Whoa, ow, ow."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Oh shit.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,What the hell is wrong with you two!? II mI mI mean you four!?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both  all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be Grampa's favorite. I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Emergency, wounded deer coming in."
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake."
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"That's my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-"
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Geez...
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"That's odd, this deer's wounded."
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,I mean it's been shot. With a gun.
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"May I help you, sir?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright, perfect. Sit still,  arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,You mean drunk?
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,No.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,What?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,Rick what the hell are you doing?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Who?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Me!
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Ahh!
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,Whoa whoa!
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Who's this now?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,She normally works on horses.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Jesus...
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Holy shit, now what?"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Right.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Right...
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh God, my head. What did you guys do?"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,You tried to kill yourself!
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,W-what're you doing?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Calling myself. Here, listen,  it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Don't fall for it, it's a bit."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails.  Yeah yeah, I heard this one.  You get the idea  we're cool now."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Fine I'll just do it myself.
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"You know, geez Rick, yyyou're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,"Oh, my God!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,It's a monster!
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,It's a monster!
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ey, ye ey, quit yellin' quit yellin'."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"What the fuck?! Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time, twice!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,How did this happen?
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Shut the fuck up! Oh, damn, I'm from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o' y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ay, damn it, were you tryin' to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies?"
2,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Oh way to go, Rick."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Yeah Grampa, way to go."
2,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Exactly, because you're being obstinate."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Yes, we're back, problem solved."
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Yes, we're back to our own time."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Well since you're goin' to time prison, I'd say you can keep em on forever."
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,Time prison?
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, well I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin' ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen."
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,Ututututut! You'd better keep back! Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Hmm...
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends."
2,A Rickle in Time,Vet,I guess that's the end of that.
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,We did it...
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, I'm talking 'bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you've get to the dolphin people, you've gone too far. Alright man, I'll talk to you later, okay.  You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Why are you doing this?
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin' you guys in is my ticket up."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,You really think I'm that stupid?
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,I cannot argue that.
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Ah, God, gross and weird!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,Chris!
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,You killed my gun!
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Summer, Morty, take off your collars!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,What? What the hell are you doing?
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Good question. I suppose the answer is
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Oh, no, what are you doin'?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ow, I'm defeated..."
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Where are we going?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,One last stop.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Where's the helicopter?
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,But the top deer surgeon...
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,I need five minutes.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had."
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Yes, oh, yes, yes!"
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that."
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Do the cabbage patch. Dododo the dance.
2,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Yeah.
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think."
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little spiece of shit."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Hey guys, we're home.Morty & Summer"
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying."
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,I'm gonna pee my pants.
2,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Doesn't feel so good, does it?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Rick,No it doesn't. It hurts.
2,A Rickle in Time,Beth,I'm gonna pee-hee-hee.
2,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90's? What is this, a 90's nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie The Craft with Fairuza Balk?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Hey man, when the hell were you?"
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,I told you past the dinosaurs.
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Come on, man, it's this way..."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is, stop, stop."
2,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, that's him. Hey, man, remember me?  I got something for your ass! You don't mess with time! You don't fuck with time, motherfucker!"
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Jerry,The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"Jerry, get a job."
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Rick,"Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job."
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Summer,"Gross, what is that thing?"
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Rick,"Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?"
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Rick,"Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand."
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"Oh, okay... I squanch my family."
2,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"What? I do, I squanch my family."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Oh boy. Time to go, Morty."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Uhh, where?"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth."
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Is it God? If its God, do we get out of school?"
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Its not God, Summer."
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Shes allowed to think its God if she wants, honey!"
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Shut up, Jerry."
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Ok
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Dad, what do you know about this?"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
2,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi, Im Mortys math teacher. Im also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together."
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,How is praying going to help?
2,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Maam, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers? Lets be rational! Ill see you at Gods house!"
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! Simon?"
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what Americas got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating heads ass!"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!
2,Get Schwifty,President,Stand down. Everybody stand down! Im the leader of these people and Im unarmed. Theres no need for any more snake-makery.
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,My name is Rick Huanhuan. This heres my grandson Morty.
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Hey.
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Ive seen enough of the galaxy to know that what weve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head wont go away until  Earth shows them its got a hit song."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms."
2,Get Schwifty,President,"All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Huanhuan. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream.  The-Dream? He wrote Umbrella and Single Ladies? You people havent heard of The-Dream?"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Youre gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,How do you know about that?
2,Get Schwifty,President,"For Gods sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps."
2,Get Schwifty,President,What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them?
2,Get Schwifty,President,Dear God.
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Good luck, Mr. President."
2,Get Schwifty,President,Huanhuan! Are you a musician?
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"I dabble, Mr. President."
2,Get Schwifty,President,Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hi, Principal Vagina. The names real, possibly Scandinavian. Im just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. Fuck all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky."
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Ah, di di di di.  Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this  can beat that what have you done for me lately?  So if you wanna excuse me, Im going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the fucking weather!  Outta my way!"
2,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Ohhhh, this is my favorite part!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, are you really a musician?"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Whos NOT a musician, Morty?"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Me!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Yeah, not with that attitude."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,B-b-but we dont have a song!
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that weve done. Were sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"All right, Morty, lets get ready to do it! Why dont you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Oh man, ok, all right, um"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here Its time to get schwifty
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Get schwifty? What the hell is that?
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Its our worlds best effort, thats what."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here Im Mr. Bulldops
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Mr. Bulldops?
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Dont analyze it, Nathan. Its working!"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,Listen! The storm is stopping!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Hey, take your pants off Its schwifty time today"
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Please be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground.
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Now hold on a second, lets be rational about this."
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"No, Im Im just saying, we dont know if theres a cause-effect relationship --"
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Oh, God, whats going on now?"
2,Get Schwifty,President,What the hell happened?
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,I think planet Earth has just been transported.
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,The head has left and sent its children!
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,Holy CRAP!
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!"
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WELL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Uhh, its probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead."
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, lets hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT."
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,DISQUALIFIED!
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,Theres one every season. Moving on to planet Arbolez Meterosos. Arbolian Meterososians. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Like were not already under enough pressure!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Geez, Morty. The guys just doing his job. Take it easy."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! Weve got six hours to come up with a song!"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Genius happens in the moment, Morty."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Thats planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! Theres only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, were not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,What?!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we cant get schwifty."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Stop saying it like its a thing! You made it up!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Hey, Morty! Could you lick my"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, cut it out! Thats not funny, Rick!"
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Ive seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.
2,Get Schwifty,President,"And whats your plan, General?"
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky."
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Our planets held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, Ill put mine in Rick and Morty. Get Schwifty was a jam."
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says hes proud of what were doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!"
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,We should pack up and leave town now.
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"I think its inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If youd stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself."
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Whoa! Look at you! Youre wearing the hat and everything!
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Heres yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?"
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Yeah, sure. Wait, what??"
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,I love you guys. You gave me life. And its the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,Dinner sounds nice.
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Father, can we please go to the Ascension?"
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Sure! Lets go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies!  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise."
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!"
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"A squeegee comes up from the garage, right? And hes got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. Hes like, Im ready!"
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3?
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Aw, damn. Were out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,What?!
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,Damn. You didnt tell me you fuck around with portals and shit.
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Thats it!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Morty, just put it down. You dont know what youre doing."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Im going to go find Mom and Dad.
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Nooooo!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Ahhhh, shit!"
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Ah, shit."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Ahhh, shit."
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Yeah.
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. Its 6 p.m., so if youre a parent, youre now entitled to adoration from your children."
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,Im going to start dinner!
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,I dont know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Shes aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become."
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,Shes not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,Thats not our business as long as Summer is thriving!
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires.
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Thats wonderful, Summer!"
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Were so proud of you. But honestly, you dont have to make dinner every night."
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, Im sorry I called you silly! Im so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!"
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,Morty.
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Birdperson?
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed."
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or??"
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I cant afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what Im sayin?"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Ice, I dont want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesnt come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, its, uh, kind of your problem too."
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Pfff. I aint worried about no Earth blowin up, man."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,What? Why not?
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Yo, this is why."
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,What the fuck? You can turn into ice?
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I dont care if it blows up! Cause Ill just be ice, floatin through space, like a comet!"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Take it from me, Ice.  You cant just  float around space not caring about stuff forever."
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Pshhhh. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick."
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to get schwifty."
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"Oh, for Gods sake, thats enough."
2,Get Schwifty,President,"What the hell are you doing, Nathan? Im the goddamn President of the United fuckin States!"
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"Im setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earths performance. And you, Mr. President, I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun!"
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Wait, wait, wait, why-why --"
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,I believe I can access the history of Ricks gun and help you get back to him.
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?"
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"All of Ricks moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?"
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I dont know what humans eat.
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Dont be gross, Tammy."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Tammy gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesnt care about anyone but himself. He doesnt think about the consequences of anything he does."
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason Im alive at all."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Whats that? Whos that baby?
2,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick?"
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"That was Chunky Tunk with Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorp Dorp. Up next, planet Earth!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Oh God! Were up?!?!
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what Headism has to offer the world."
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,The world?
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Headism is a hit. Were taking it worldwide and would like Jerry to be our churchs Head of Advertising.
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,You would?
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Beth, wed like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to Head of Medicine."
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,Thats my dream! Thats my dream.
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh we cant."
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,Absolutely not.
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Im sorry?
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Weve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be our daughter, not this person shes become."
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Well take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? Im sick of pretending that were together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because youre the love of my life!
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"And Im lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!"
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Please dont do this, please dont do this! Summer!"
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I dont know what to do with it and it hurts."
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,Youre going to be ok!  You will come back as babies!
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,I AM a baby! Im a baby NOW!
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President!
2,Get Schwifty,President,This is Bluebird. Code tango-niner-alpha. Abort launch. Abort! Hello?  Hes blocked me out.
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!"
2,Get Schwifty,President,"It wont matter how schwifty you get, Morty. The Generals got nukes set to launch halfway through Earths song!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?
2,Get Schwifty,President,Can the Popes dick fit through a donut?
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Uhhh, Im not sure?"
2,Get Schwifty,President,Exactly!
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Ahem.  Uhhh lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts."
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Headward free now to rise!
2,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin angry!
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Im really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons on this thing!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Mr. President, if Ive learned one thing today, its that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups ooh, tough crowd."
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Im sure that has that has nothing to do with this.
2,Get Schwifty,Summer,The heads are displeased!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Morty!
2,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,The heads love this! They love it when we DONT kill the Smith family!
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,No! Stop that! Youre not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
2,Get Schwifty,President,Call off the nuclear strike! This is the President. Stop the nuclear missile launch!
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Just launch the missiles!
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,BOO! NOT COOL!
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Im the only one that speaks to the heads!
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,DISQUALIFIED!
2,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,DISQUALIFIED! DISQUALIFIED!
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Thats right, its me, Ice-T! I care now! You made me care more! With all due respect, Id like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,"What do you say, Rick?"
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,I say  Lets do it!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,All right!
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Ohhhh yeahhhh!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Come on, here we go!"
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Ohhhh yeahhhh!
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,Say it with me!
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!
2,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"After 988 seasons of Planet Music, the Cromulons have decided to declare Earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye!"
2,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,Did he just say musical reality show?
2,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Yeah, its possible that we may have been correlating some things that werent actually related at all."
2,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!
2,Get Schwifty,Beth,We should go get him.
2,Get Schwifty,President,"I hope I can call on you again if we need you, Morty."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?
2,Get Schwifty,President,"Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, well deny it and probably worse."
2,Get Schwifty,Morty,Understood.
2,Get Schwifty,Nathan,DIIIIEEEE!!!!
2,Get Schwifty,President,Why didnt he turn into a snake?
2,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch snake holster on the leg."
2,Get Schwifty,President,I love this man!
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F. Father."
2,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,Woahh!
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Not anymore.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,You're overreacting!
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Summer,Is he going to die?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Go in the waiting room, Dad."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,A sequel.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,Where am I?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"Relax Mr. Smith, you're in an alien hospital. I mean to you it's an alien hospital, to me you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,My goodness.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,I see-WAIT! What?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call ""your balls"". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a working heart for the most important man in the universe!"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Yeah, but, I mean-"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,"Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Morty let's-let's see what else is on.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,Okay.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Is that something we should be concerned about?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Just stay away from the coffee machine.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,"In a world, where there are eight Jan-Michael Vincent's."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,And sixteen quadrants. There's only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be in two quadrants at once.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,"Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,Jan-Michael Vincent's are used up.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Nope.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,"This January, It's time to Mike down your Vincent's. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,That's Jan-Michaels.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,"Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"All right, Morty you've done it!"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,Got it.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"Oh, do you think she'll be okay with this?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Smith family?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Yes?
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,WHAT!?!
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he's gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It's--It's--It's--It's, I mean."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. That his fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Hundreds of billions.
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones."
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Beth, can we talk about this privately?"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, ""I prefer to keep my penis."""
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!"
2,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?"
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Rick,"Morty, hurry!"
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Goth Creature,Return the Truth Tortoise!
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Rick,"Morty, whatever you do, don't drop the Truth Tortoise! Also, really important--whatever you do, don't look into its eyes!"
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Morty,"I-I did look at it, Rick! I've been looking at it!"
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Rick,"Now you're gonna know everything, Morty!  Good job! Way to go! You fucked everything up!"
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Morty,It's in my head! Oohhhh!!
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Morty,"Oh, geez... I-I can't get that Truth Tortoise out of my head."
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Rick,"Yeah, I told you not to look into its eyes. Hey, Morty, let's watch some Interdimensional Cable. Remember how we used to do that?"
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Morty,"Rick, I can't-- I can't go on. I-I can't go on like this with the Truth Tortoise shit in my head. I-I wish you could just--"
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Rick,Erase the memory from your mind?
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Morty,How did you know I was gonna say that?
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Rick,"Come on, Morty, come with me."
3,Morty's Mind Blowers,Rick,After you.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Tricia,"So, Jessica, I heard you broke up with Brad."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Holly,Who are you gonna date; now that you can date anyone?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"I don?'t know. I think I'd like to be on my own for a bit. I mean, obviously if someone special comes along. B-But I mean really special, like, nothing I?'ve even remotely considered in the past."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Holyshitholyshitholyshit.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Tricia,I want that kind of love like that docking kind of love.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Holly,"Oh, yeah."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Tricia,"Like, penis in the foreskin kind of love Mm-hmm just, like, warm, just like..."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Hey...  ah...
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Everybody, fuck off. Morty, I need your help. W-W-W-We We need to go on a quick adventure."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,You said I could go to school today.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"That was before I needed something, Morty. There?'s a plasma shard in the Abadango Cluster. A princess has it. If I get it, I?'ll be awesome."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"We?'ve been going non-stop, Rick. It?'s not healthy. You know, these are my teenage years. I-I just found out Jessica?'s single."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Oh, that?'s Wow, Morty. Wow. What an exciting life you lead.  Let?'s go. In and out, 20 minutes adventure."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,They?'re on our tail!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Steady, Morty. Five cetons."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Wha!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Fire!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Pull up, Morty, pull up! Pull up!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Fuck.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Oh, fuck! Fuck! Ahh! Ahh!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,I can?'t fucking do this anymore!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,That was seriously fucked up. We almost died.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,So you agree?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Fuck yes! That w... T-This was insane! That was pure luck. I was not in control of that situation at all.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Look at this, Morty. Look at my fucking hand. Look at this shit."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Why do you... Keep doing this to us?!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"I don?'t know, Morty. Maybe I hate myself, maybe I think I deserve to die. I-I-I-I don?'t I don?'t know!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,We need a vacation.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Isn?'t that something?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,You were right. Best day spa in the galaxy.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"It's not even cruel, either. These things are just doing what they do in the wild. It loves swallowing stressed-out creatures for 20 minutes and then puking them up."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,My whole body?'s like a baby?'s ass.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Alien,"Complimentary psychological detox? Removes all your cognitive toxins,  purifies your system."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Oof, this guy on commission or something?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,I don?'t think. Are you on commission?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Alien,We?'re not on  commission. We get  paid by the hour. There?'s no incentive really-
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Oh, my god. Okay, listen. W-W-W-We?'ll try the machine, but but I?'d like you to try something. Try swallowing the giant ball of snot that?'s dangling around in the back of your throat.  It?'s disgusting. Nobody wants to hear that. Ahem. Ahem! That?'s what you do."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,": Okay, Rick, come on. Enough."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Wow, did you hear me bite that guy's head off? Geez, I really need to chill."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Maybe you should go through twice.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"All right, mister comedy man, you don?'t have to bust my balls. You?'re not helping things."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this no-"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Morty!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,R-Rick.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Morty!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Ugh! What Happened?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"We blew up, idiot! Are you really that stupid? Obviously the guy I yelled at overloaded the machine. It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty, motherfucker!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"But this might do it. Run, Morty!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,E-Everything hurts!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"That?'s because you?'re worthless!  Jesus, how big was this explosion? I?'m a genius. I don?'t have time for this shit."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"W-W-We?'re in Hell, aren?'t we, Rick?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"You?'re so stupid, Morty. You?'re an  idiot. There?'s no such thing as Hell."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"I believe you, but I just want to die."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,You can die when I say so. I control you. I control the universe! Why am I bragging about that? I have nothing to prove. I?'m surrounded by inferior pieces of shit and ?C
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Toxins. We?'re not in Hell, Morty.  We?'re in the detoxifier. The machine didn?'t blow up. It worked normally.  It removed our toxins.  We?'re the toxins."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Are you listening, you stupid little garbage person?!  We're what got removed!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Alien,I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Alien,It?'s all good.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"It?'s nice of you to let me off the hook. It?'s still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Alien,"Believe me, man, I?'ve been working here a long time. I get it."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Not at all.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Radio,Grab my terrifolds...
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,What is that?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,I just hit shuffle.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Are you kidding?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Haha.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"This universe.  Oh, excuse me."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"We should listen to one random song a day, you know? We?'d end up hearing more songs we didn?'t like, but we?'d discover a lot more that we did."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"That is an interesting concept. You know, it makes me wonder if there?'s an algorithmic expression that could achieve the ideal ratio. Pfft! Listen to me, trying to calculate happiness over here."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Hoo, if anyone could, Rick."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Hey, here?'s something no science could measure. I?'m real proud to be your grandpa, Morty."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Thanks, Rick. I love you."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Yeah, motherfucker! Yeah! Get it! Get some! Right up your fucking bitch ass, you fuck! Guess who just discovered a new element?! You think you could do that, Morty? You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no. If God exists, it?'s fucking me!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"While you were flapping your parasitic turd holster, I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty. What do you think about that?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Uh I th-I think my voice is annoying.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"It is, and it?'s your best quality."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,So true.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Mr. Goldenfold,"Now, who can tell me the common denominator of these two factions? You don?'t know or y??all just bored?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Hey, listen, you know, wh-If we?'re all bored over here, wouldn?'t the common denominator be you?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Mr. Goldenfold,"Damn, Morty. That?'s hilarious. Normally I would come down on any kind of disruption, but it seems to represent a positive change for your character. Class dismissed!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Off screen student,"Awesome, Morty!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Student with glasses,"You done good, Morty."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Off screen student 2,Oh yeah!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Female student,"Thanks for the advice, Morty."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,You got it.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Female student 2,"I did it, Morty!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,I knew you could.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Mitch,"Hey, Morty, remember yesterday when I couldn?'t play the trombone? Well, check this out!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Just like I told you, Mitch. The music was in your heart the whole time."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Female student looking into her mirror,Stupid hat Wish I had the courage to just be myself.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Female Student,There you are.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Bully,"You might have all these idiots fooled, but I know you?'re still the same pathetic loser hiding behind a confident facade. I know that because I?'m doing the same thing, brother. I?'m not alone anymore!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"Hey, Morty. Word around school is you?'ve become super healthy."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"I don?'t know about all that. I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of haven?'t taken you to dinner-itis. Might be fatal. Hahaha!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,": Hey, kids. Uh, hope I?'m not interrupting. Morty, a moment of your time?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Happy to help, Rick."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"I hate to bug you with this, but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint, highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone. Listen."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"It?'s a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only. You know, if if if something?'s worth saying, I-it?'s worth eye contact."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call back to the spa we went to, Morty. I thought I could hear a voice in there, so I enhanced it, a-and listen."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Hey, asshole!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Oh, man!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Remember us?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Oh, I don?'t like confrontation!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"You fucked us, you pieces of garbage! That?'s right, you?'re fucking garbage, not us. I?'m a fucking genius and a god. You really think this thing can hold me? I?'m gonna rip your throat..."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities, their own will to live?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Sounds like he?'s in a lot of pain. Lot. O. Pain. But, you know, you shouldn?'t have to deal with that, man. You know, l-let?'s work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga. It?'s amazing. You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at-risk preteen-"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"I don?'t think I can just blow this off, Morty. If I had known it worked this way, I wouldn?'t have detoxed. Well, I would have because I was toxic. Now I?'m detoxed and I?'m accountable to my toxins, right? I-It?'s a dilemma."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,I think I know what to do.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Morty!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Rick! Haha.  You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain that misses eating all them big fat problems. Focus on the good thing. Trust me, things are good. Taking that away from me, heh. That wouldn?'t be healthy."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Hahaha! Hahahaha! Oh, man. World?'s Greatest Grandpa, for reals.  It?'s not just a coffee cup for you, bud. You?'re legit."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,I love drums. I never took drum lessons. Why? Limitations. We are addicted to our own limitations. How amazing is that? Is the kale prepared in the kitchen? I?'ll have a water.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,Uh How is the "cru-dite?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Waiter,Crudit??. It?'s a cup of carrot sticks.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Ha! It?'s okay! Pronounce it however you want. Words are just things. Please. Thank you. We?'re having a conversation.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"God, I am so excited to finally have dinner with you. You know how long I?'ve been waiting for this? It?'s like, whew! I-I-I wish you?'d shut up, though. Just kidding. You know, you?'re so quiet. What?'s wrong? W-Why don?'t you tell me about yourself? What?'s the atmosphere like on planet Jessica? Where?'s the equator, what are the vacations, a-and the holidays? I mean, you know, haha, are they the same time? Talk to me."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,Well I... like this restaurant.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Holy shit! Holy shit! We have a moron over here! I?'m an idiot. I can?'t believe I haven?'t thought of this. You have to do this detox thing I did. It?'s an alien spa, you go through it, fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa, wheeew wheeew! Sucks everything out. Everything that was holding me back, everything bad, I mean, it just sluuuurp! Hahaha! Right?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"Cooooool.  Oh, my God! I can?'t believe this."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Yeah, phones are awful, I downgraded to-"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"I totally forgot my I have a thing, and..."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Things are good.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"You know what? Why am I doing that? That?'s more rude than the truth. Look, I?'m sorry, Morty. I just don?'t think..."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Do not. Even. You have no need to explain. It?'s all good.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,I think you?'d get bored with me.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"E-Exactly. Look, the sparks aren?'t flying. This is what dating is for, you know? First date, no sparks. No damage, no worries. Life is a highway. We?'re gonna ride it all night lonnngg!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Gonna eat some ""crudite. Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm.  All right. You know, the evening continues.  Okay, here we go."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Ma??am, I?'m afraid I have some bad news for you. Your money?'s no good here. Haha!  I?'ll I?'ll get the next round, sir."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,Aren?'t you a child?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Only in the ways that matter. Morty.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,Stacy.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"I?'ve been watching you drink, Stacy. I get the feeling you?'ve got a hard job. I wonder what it takes to please you. That?'s the job I want Part time, full time, I want to be good at it, bad at it, I want to get promoted, fired, corner office, hostile takeover, workplace accident I?'m on my knees, Stacy. Praying, worshipping, begging, whatever you want.  What do you think about that?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,Okay. Fuck it.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Tink.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Mm! Let?'s ask my grandpa. He?'s a scientist.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Hey, Rick, are you familiar with ""Ben Wa"" technology?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Morty, great news. I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the containment unit from their detoxifier."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Why?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Because we?'re coming home, bitch!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,What is this?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real. Oh oh, and I think you dropped something, too!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"I don?'t want to be on camera. I?'m ugly and gross, please."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacey,Should I go?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"You?'re your own person, Stacy."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,Then I?'d like to stay.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Rick, please tell me you?'re not trying to put that stuff back inside of us."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Morty, I?'m sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us. We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Motherfucker!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,See? They?'re living in pain.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"That?'s what they do, Rick, they live in pain. They are pain, you know? They they?'re all the bad parts of us, which, by the way, includes our dishonesty, so how do you know this isn?'t all some sort of crazy trick?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Oh, so now because I?'m made entirely of toxins I?'m also a liar? Fuck you, you little sociopath.  You hear this, Morty?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Oh, everybody hates me. I can tell. Y-You all hate me."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"All right, shut up, Morty. Healthy Rick, are we doing this or what?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you to step into the booth."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Don?'t negotiate with that little turd, dummy. You?'re the Rick. You need to show dominance. Morty, booth, now."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Booth! Come on, Morty."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Don?'t touch me!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Morty, do the healthy thing and voluntarily retoxify yourself."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Nooooo!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,Is it wrong if I think this is kind of hot?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Let me out of here! Stacy, help! Open the door!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,"I need to hear our safe word, Morty."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,What are you doing?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,"I?'ll do anything for you, Morty."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,No!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,It worked! Haha! Yes! That idiot believed every word. Now let?'s see how he enjoys living in that shit tank.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"He?'s right behind me, isn?'t he?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,He?'s in front of you.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Oh.  My eyes are still adjusting.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacy,"Uh, is this like a sex dungeon? I guess I should?'ve been paying attention."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"After 70 years of being bottled up inside a  sentimental jackass, I finally get to live my own life."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,You said we were merging.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything! Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,So you were just gonna trap us in that tank? T-That was your plan?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Not was, motherfucker, still is."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Kill him, Rick!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,I don?'t like this! This is scary!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"All right, you asked for it."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Did I ask for this?  Did I ask for this?  Huh? Did I?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Groin System 6000,Assessing threat to groin.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Groin System 6000. Kill him!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Groin System 6000,That... is my groin?'s user.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Believe me, I got a lot more use out of that thing than he ever did."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Groin System 6000,You know what? Not my table.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Mrs. Pancakes,You do know me.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Summer,"What the hell, Grandpa Rick?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Fuck you, Summer!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Sorry, Summer!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Okay, okay, take it easy. Don?'t do it."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,I love you. Good boy. Daddy?'s little boy.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Summer, get out of here! Go!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Oh, who?'s that?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Who?'s that over there? Oh, no."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"You see the bad man in front of you? You?'re a good little boy, you?'re gonna get him. You?'re gonna get him."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Ahh! Son of a...
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Nice try, asshole."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,We can resolve  our issues. We don?'t need to resort to over-the-top- Aah!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"I-I did it, Rick. I got the tank! I-I?'m a piece of shit, but I got the tank!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"You?'re going in that tank, motherfucker. You?'re gonna  live in that toxic shit wasteland like I had to do!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Ahh! Ow!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"That?'s right, motherfucker! You?'re going in that fucki-"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Beth,Dads?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Okay, just Just leave her out of it."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Beth,What?'s going on?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"All right, fuck this. Time for plan B If I can?'t trap you in a toxic world,"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Ahh!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,I?'ll just make the whole world toxic.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"It?'s okay, girls. I-I?'m so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior. I-If you?'d like I can go out in the g-garden, pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Beth,What did the booger version of you mean when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Believe me, sweetie, that man?'s motivations are a mystery."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Screw that, Rick. We got to stop him. What?'s the last thing you?'d think about doing with that tank thing?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Morty, I appreciate what you?'re trying to do, but it?'s not our place, you know, to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse. Our our toxins have as much a right to their worldview as-"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Morty, how is it healthy to slap me?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours, you useless old turd."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Wait. That?'s it.  How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it? It can?'t. It must be by the individual?'s own definition of toxicity. That means...
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Beth,Dad!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"What the What the hell, Rick?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,I?'ll explain on the way.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"This ""Moon Tower,"" Morty,  is the perfect height and metallic composition for the  amplification and beaming of toxic energies. What do you think about that, Morty? Are you excited about that, Morty?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Oh, man. I?'m just freaked out. I-It?'s too high up here."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Once I flip this switch, the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Priest,As we praise our loving Father-
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Priest,God is a lie! We made him up for money!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Man,Santa Claus isn?'t real.  You were all mistakes!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Hahahahahaha! We fucking did it, Morty. Put your fucking hands in the air.  Yeah, you little piece of shit."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Remember me?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Didn?'t you learn last time that you can?'t beat me?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else.  This."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Ahh!!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,You think I give a shit?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"I know you give a shit, dummy. Because I know I don?'t. Here?'s another thing I know. The decryption key that neutralizes the virus.  You want it? Come and get it. Merge with me and you?'ll know how to save him."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Pfft. Come on, man. I?'ve been trapped in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions, but this is the all-time weakest bluff that I?'ve ever-"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Ow-Ohh!!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,He?'s cutting your time in half. 10 minutes.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Ohh! It hurts!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,What is your problem?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement, my narcissism, my crippling loneliness, my irrational attachments."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"They must be somewhere. They ain?'t over here, bro."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,I?'m not going back in there!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Honestly, I don?'t care either way. I hate having you in me. And when I say ""honestly"" you can believe it, because we both know I?'m too healthy to lie. Watch."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"All right! Knock it off! You?'re not impressing anyone.  Morty, not that I give a shit, but are you okay?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Jesus Christ, it hurts."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Relax, quit your bitching. Y-You?'re gonna be fine. Grandpa?'s here."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Hahahahahaha.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,You think that?'s funny?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things. Oh, wait, you can?'t. You?'re literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture. I guess it?'s just funny because you?'ve never done anything but complain about me being in charge, but if I ever gave you the wheel we?'d be dead in five minutes."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Ah, Rick?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"You poor, dumb, sick animal."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,Augh... Rick?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Rick,"Ahh!  Just do it! Just do it, you piece of-"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Aaahhh! I?'m back, baby!  Regular Rick! Master of both worlds! Check it it out!  Excuse me.  Now we?'ll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam. Man, I really over think shit when I?'m angry."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Priest,God is not a lie.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Crying boy,Mommy! Mommy!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Ha! All right, Morty, now it?'s time we re-merge your little ass."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"You?'re a better man than me, Rick. I?'m healthy enough to admit that!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,That kid is a real piece of shit.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Toxic Morty,"Y-Y-You?'re gonna save me, right?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty. Part of me really wanted to."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Worker,"I?'m telling you, these shares are hot."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Worker 2,Yeah. That sounds like a good idea. It?'s definitely a good idea.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you?  That?'s right, and ask around, I never do, Duane."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Let me put this real simple. This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane Two lockers down.  So step up or step off, Duane. Blue pill or red pill, what?'ll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane. You?'re the boss.  Heinholz Biotech Million and a half at thirty-three."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Worker in a red shirt,Heh.You little fucking monster.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm!  Go for Morty.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica on the phone,"Hi, Morty. It?'s Jessica. Look, can we just talk for a minute?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"Come back, Morty. I miss you."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,You miss the old me. You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love ?'em back.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,How do you know I don?'t want to love you?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Because I?'m not sick.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jacquelyn,Ex-girlfriend? Should I be jealous?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,There?'s nothing to be jealous of.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jacquelyn,I just realized that I?'m scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night. I can cancel.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,We?'ll be together. That?'s a date.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jacquelyn,"You are the perfect man.  Oh, sweetie,  I think you hit the wrong button. You didn?'t hang up."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Huh. How ??bout that?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Sorry, tiny American Psycho,  time to take the opposite of your medicine."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Do what you got to do.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Oh! Ow! Ahh!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"So, how do you feel, Morty?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Ah, geez. I?'m miserable."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,Am I good or what?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"I guess it?'s worth it, though, to know how much you care."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,"Care? Me? Morty, I?'m fine with you. I only did this for him."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"You lying bitch. She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me. ""Did did d-did you get a new Morty yet?"""
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,I wasn?'t crying!
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Jacquelyn, I I-I-I wasn?'t who I said I was."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jacquelyn,You weren?'t a 14-year-old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker?
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Oh. I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasn?'t I?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jacquelyn,You were up front about everything. You were my soul mate.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,"Well No-Not anymore. I?'ll, um Y-You can keep the apartment, and and and, uh the drones."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,She can?'t keep the drones. They turn into a little Voltron robot. They?'re awesome.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,You can?'t keep the drones.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Tricia,"So, how was your date with Brad?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,It wasn?'t a date. We were just having lunch.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Holly,"You guys are getting back together, aren?'t you?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Rick,"Morty, I need your help on an adventure. Eh, ""need"" is a strong word. We need door stops, but a brick would work, too."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Morty,Okay.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,Morty.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Jessica,Good to have you back.
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Tricia,"Have you ever been peed on before? Oh, my God. Yum."
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Credits song,"Hey, did you ever want to hold a terrifold? I got one right here Grab my terri-flap Squeeze it Grab it, squeeze it Tug on my terri-flap Hey, I want to take you to The terrifold dance Wanna come with me? You can grab my holdie-folds Squeeze ?'em tight You son of a bitch. Suck my holdie-flappy folds Lick my flappy foldie-holes My terri-flaps in your mouth Suck my flaps, you piece of shit. Whoo!"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Man,"Although only a handful of moon towers remain today, they were popular in the late 19th century. An entire town could be illuminated by...  What the hell is this?"
3,Rest and Ricklaxation,Stacey,Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"It's called ""carpe diem"", Morty. Look it up."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,All of it. You were looking right at me. I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Bye, Dad. Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,I'm ready when you a--
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Bitch, I was ready yest--"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,"Bye, sweetie."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Well, I-I better--"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,Sure. Sounds important.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,"If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh--"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,Okay.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Wind,Loser...
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,What? Hello?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,They all have mohawks!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mohawk Guy,Ah!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Death Stalker #1,Light them up.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mohawk Guy,Ahh!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Give me your flask!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Holy shit, Summer for the win!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Here we go.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Isotope 322.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Summer!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Hold on. I want to try something.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Colossus,Your blood will be my lotion.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Whoa. That was cool.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Colossus,"Kill me, please."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Okay, but not because you told me to."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Summer!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Okay, getting darker."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Jesus Christ. Summer!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Aw, come on."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,I am Hemorrhage. You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger. We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. They're basically pussies.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,What is your deal lately?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"That is our glowing rock. We carry it with us for desecration, to remind us there are no gods."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Kids, weird pitch: let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Okay.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,What?!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people. I'm going."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Sounds good. Stay hydrated.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Lunch server,Bicep or quadricep?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Uh...  bicep.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"No. Okay, I'll level with you."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Isotope 322.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Summer just ran off with strangers that have ""Death"" in their name, and the rest of their name was ""Stalkers""!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the ""F"" out of ""H""!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"""Distract""? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be..."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Death Stalker #2,"Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Death Stalker #3,"Ooh, burn!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Ugh! Hey!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,I-I didn't do that!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Ooh! Help! Help!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Death Stalker #4,"Oh, sweet, man!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli,"And so it begins, my pretties!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Just stick and moo--oove, Morty! Wear him out!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"After the ""boom-boom"", some adapted to the new truth, and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes, clinging to the lie of the beforefore times. The raidy-rays rotted them away, leaving only their love for the vertvertisements on billyboards."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Jesus Christ, did the ""boomy-booms"" blow up all your ""wordy-word books""?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,You mean dictionaries?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,I think I was a child before the boom-booms. I think I looked like this.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Want to piss on it?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,Get out of my head.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli,Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Okay, no more!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli,And he wants more!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"No, I don't!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Someone, make this stop!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Morty.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother! Not that family means anything! Hemorrhage: This family does."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,Leave?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,I'm not leaving.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"There is no ""leave"". We are united, or we are enemies."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Death Stalker #5,"Hey, the Green Rock is gone!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Death Stalker #6,"Oh, no!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,When did I lose control here?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"All right, you know what? Fuck it!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Blue Footprint Guy,My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Nope, regular blood."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,Dad?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Hi, sweetie."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,Where are the kids?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,Not panicked. At all.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Not a mistake, no!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Soldier,What? Wait a minute.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Soldier,"What's the matter, you piece of crap? Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you. Ha!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Soldier,It can't be. It can't be!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Soldier,I was just following orders --
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Whoa, whoa!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Soldier,-- I was just following orders!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Death Stalker #7,Ahh!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Soldier,I'll tell you where my boss lives! He's in the castle!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"This isn't over, is it?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,Ugh!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"We don't apologize, and we have no god. But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"What about the weird guys on leashes, then?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,They're more like interns.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Cool, cool."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Sorry.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,It's okay.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Can I see?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,No one has seen my true face and lived.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Well, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't care what you look like."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,Hmm?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,I just...I didn't expect you to have a mustache.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,You hate it.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"No. I like it. I guess -- How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of ""mustache,"" in that it's a specific facial accessory. So, it's kind of like...Do you guys have the phrase ""hat on a hat""?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,I can shave it.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter. It's you.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemmorhage,"Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter. Obviously, I know that. I'm not weak. I'm just thinking, ""Well, why not get rid of this?"" You just kill everyone that sees it, and it's and it's hot under here  wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part. So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself? Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean, it's like that guy you killed when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. I hated that guy, because, why-why are you doing that? And how can you not see how fake that is? And the whole time, I'm the same thing. I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because --"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Leash Man,"Hey, I'm doing a coffee run -- Never mind."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,I am Summer.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Summer, state your deal."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,"My deal is that I am, like, totally fine."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Morty?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,"Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg. Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,All right.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,It's dinnertime.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,"Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,"MS, MR, and Rick, in unison",No problem.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,"Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,"Uh, okay, weirdo."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,"How's school, Morty?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,"I like school and stuff, kind of. And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were -- quote mode -- ""staying together for the kids."" End quote mode."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,"""Quote mode"". I like that. You millennials. Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,"All I know is, totally, you look great."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,"Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. It's crazy."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,So happy.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,"So happy. Happy family, man. We got this family in the bag."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't --"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,I don't know why I'm crying. It's not --
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Well, try crying 15% less?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,"Mom, emotions are human. You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,"Yeah. Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,I have to call Jerry.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,Your feelings are coming from a --
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,"Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti --"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Slaveowner,"Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland. And as for you, Genital Washer --"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Ahh! Oh, gee!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Slaveowner,"Oh, god. Look, whoever you are, you should know that killing me won't change a thing."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Slaveowner,"Please. Slavery was a family business. I didn't ask to be born into it. If anything, I'm the victim here!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Slaveowner,"I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for, if you're feeling out the room."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Slaveowner,"Aw, fuck!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Rick?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Yeah, well, too late."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,I want you and your sister to come home.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,Wait. Can you stay to show us more?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Ugh. Goddamn it.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli,"Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Oh, you know, Eli. Same shit, different day."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli's Girlfriend,"Hey, Summer! Guess what. One man entered, one man comes out in nine months."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Oh, congratulations, guys."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli,"Uh, Summer, one more thing. We noticed that you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin --"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,I got it.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli's Girlfriend,She's a piece of work.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Eli,"They both are, right?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,I'm home.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"Hey, babe."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Ah, Summer's home."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"Hey, there she is!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,Blood Dome playoffs.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"Oh, I don't know. I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log. I didn't know that's how we measured success."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Oh, there he is. There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking TV!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"Jesus Christ, when did you become a monster?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,I was a monster when you met me! We were monsters! We didn't care about anything!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,I still don't!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"Ohh! Ding, ding, ding!"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Uh, we should go to the garage."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,"Oh, my God."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,Uh-huh.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,La-di-da-di-fucking-da. The only one committed to not caring?!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point, I get it. Let's just go home."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,Coolsies.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Hemorrhage,Noooooooooo!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,Downbeat!
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Rick,I enjoy this game.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,"Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Summer,"We will return, possibly in different clothing."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,Why do we have to go into the garage?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Rick,You know  it is  required.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,"I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,What the fuck?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Mechanical Morty,Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiii...Hello.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,What the hell just happened?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,We're not gonna finish playing Downbeat?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Rick,"What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, ""Downbeat""? No, thank you."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,Sure.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,Thanks.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,"Morty, are you okay?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,"You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Beth,"Yeah. Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Morty,What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,Summer.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back."
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,Thanks.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,"I know the perfect place for it, which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bullshit, am I right?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,Cool.
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Summer,"So lots of hookers outside, huh?"
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,Is that what they are?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Jerry,Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You-You want a snack? You-You want my unemployment check?
3,Rickmancing the Stone,Wind,...loser...
3,The ABC's of Beth,TV,"In local news, child murderer Joseph Eli Lipnip is scheduled to die tomorrow by lethal injection, his execution already drawing dozens more spectators than the death of TV news. Carla?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Carla,The man that once ate his own son...
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,Wow. He's really getting executed after all this time. You know the son that he ate was...
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,Your best friend Tommy. We know. Stop true-crime bragging.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"I was traumatized, Summer. Okay, your generation wouldn't get that."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,"Bitch, my generation gets traumatized for breakfast."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"It took years of therapy to even process the reality. I mean, when I was a kid I just told myself that tommy had gotten lost in the magical realm of Froopyland."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,"""Froopyland?"""
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"My make-believe world. I know the name's stupid, but it was so real to me."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,Aren't you guys supposed to be at your father's for custody weekend?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,"We're not in a hurry. Dad sleeps until sundown. Can we talk a little bit more, about this Froopy..."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,Not the bubble gun! There's no air...
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"I gotta say, I am warming up to the bubble gun."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"You know, if you're so great at naming things, why don't you do it from now on"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,What?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Froopyland. Was it my best work? I don't know. Does it deserve to be shit on creatively? Yeah, that's right. I agree with your look of horrified realization. You can be very inconsiderate sometimes."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Here it is. You know, I collapsed a quantum tesseract to..."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"Dad, I don't care how you made it. I want to know if Tommy's still in there!"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Relax, Beth.  If he is, we'll find him. He'll be the only sun-bleached skeleton with non-imaginary DNA."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,Tommy! Tommy! This is a nightmare. I can't believe you used to lock me up in this glorified chicken coop.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Chicken coop?  Those are procedurally generated clouds, Beth. That river is a rainbow. Literally. Come on, I-I-I put real elbow grease into this place."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"Well, you're supposed to put elbow grease into your daughter!"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,Gross.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,Do you think something ate him?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,Nope. Froopyland creatures were designed to be harmless. He definitely just starved to death.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,I could have been the one who starved to death in here. What if I'd gotten hurt?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"God you're right. I'm a terrible dad. Well, nothing to live for. Goodbye cruel world!"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,Dad!
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Oh, how do you like that? What kind of merciless creature makes the ground bouncy? I'm gonna have to drown myself."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,Unh!
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Oh, no. Oh, the water's breathable? Who went and did that?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"Oh, whatever."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Yeah, whatever. A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2, and it breaks the front page of Reddit, but I'm Charles Manson because I gave you your own world instead of an iPad. I think the words you're looking for are... Aah!  Holy fuck! Shit! This thing has claws!"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"Yeah, I get it. It's a childproof world."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"No, no, seriously, this hurts really bad! This thing is sinking its razor-sharp claws in...  Aah! Shit!"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"You've made your point, Dad."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,Dad?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,Whose idea was this stupid custody weekend thing?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,I-I think it's supposed to help prevent abandonment issues.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,I want to be abandoned.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,"Yeah, I'm talking about Dad."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,"Wow, Dad. Your place looks way less like a crackhouse."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,"It's actually clean, like a cocaine house. Dad, what's going on?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"I'm simply centered, activated..."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,And telekinetic?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Pretty cool, huh? Check it out. Who wants a smoothie?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Oh... Oh, no. Uh, oh, God. Summer... Summer, can you..."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,Aah!
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,Sorry.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Kiara,"You have much to learn, my Uloo."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Morty, Summer, this is Kiara. She's a Krootabulan warrior priestess from Krootabulon."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,"I-I know where Krootabulans are from, Dad. Uh, Chaimuntolo."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Kiara,"Chaimuntolo, younglings."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,Hymen...cholo.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Kiara,Your father's mind holds love for you. I am humbled to meet in physicality.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,"Dad, are you --"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"In love with a badass sexy alien lady? Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer. You tell me."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,I wasn't going to ask if you were in love since you barely know her.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,Summer. Kiara and I met on that interstellar dating service Rick was always suggesting when your mom and I were together. And things just kind of clicked.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Kiara,We must move! Our reservation is at 7:00.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"I hate to see her leave, but I love to watch her phase shift away. I'm sure you noticed what she has three of, but guess what she has two of."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Oof!  All right, knock it off! Listen, I've been giving you a pass because I'm charmed that life finds a way, but --  Aah! All right, you know what?  Ouch!  Oh!  Uhh! Ouch!  God!  Aah! Agh!"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"Oh, yeah, this place is the safest. Best dad ever. Can't you just say, ""I admit it, I screwed up""?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Uh, What would be the point of that?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"You can't do it, can you? You can't just fucking apologize."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Okay, okay, Beth, I'm sorry... You think you deserve an apology."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Hey, don't look at me. You let your kid roll around on the floor of a target, it's gonna get stepped on."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Huh. Well, here's the problem right here. We've got a bunch of Froopyland procedural carbons all gummed up and mixed in with real human DNA."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures, creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring, and then consuming their proteins, sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"It's just a working theory. Of course, if that's the case, I expect he'd be worshiped as a kind of god by a medieval-level society of his least-delicious children."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Froopy soldier,"Halt! You are now prisoners of our exalted ruler, giver and taker of life, humper and consumer of mortality, dispenser of life --"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Rick,"Yes, if I could interrupt? We're way ahead of the reveal here."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Beth,"Yeah, just take us to King Tommy."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,I thought warrior priestesses could only keave Krootabulon on a hunt.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Mmm.  Thank you, sweetie."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,I hope it's not human season.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Kiara,I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix. I would never hunt a human.  Your father and I are soul-bonded.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,Soul-bonded?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,"Um, does your planet have shorter days, because you guys are moving kind of fast, no?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Go get him, honey!  She's always hunting.  She probably knew a Varrix worked here, and that's why she said the Yelp reviews didn't matter."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,"Dad, do you understand how serious Krootabulon soul-bonding is?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know. It's got such a casual name. If you want to lecture anyone about commitment, start with your mom."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,"Oh, my God. Dad, is that what this about? Are you rushing into a new thing to get back at Mom?"
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Every weekend, you two have told me to move on."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer,"Move on, like, out of bed. Like, stop using paper towels for toilet paper, not move on into a sloppy rebound."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Morty,"Dad, you need to slow down, rethink this soul bond."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,"Why don't you just say what you really mean? You think it's cool that having sex with her gives me telekinesis and you recognize she's got a hot bod like Cheetara in ""Thundercats,"" but you're grossed out by her avocado-shaped head and blue skin, and you think I want to put a bag and a wig on her head.  After all the time and energy I spent teaching you two about race...  ...you ended up racist."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Kiara,"Soon your world will be rid of Varrix. Tomorrow, we celebrate."
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,We could take the kids to the water park.
3,The ABC's of Beth,Kiara,We celebrate with a hunt!
3,The ABC's of Beth,Jerry,Ooh. You kids want to hunt?
3,The ABC's of Beth,Summer and Morty,Yes.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Mr. President.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"It's about time, gentlemen. Rick, do you need to drink in here?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Yes.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Here's the adventure. Some kind of alien... googa has infested the Kennedy sex Tunnels. I want it hunted down and taken out.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Kennedy sex Tunnels?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Naturally, you'll forget you saw them, along with, in order of national embarrassment, the Truman Cocaine Lounge, the McKinley Hooker Dump, and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum. He didn't free them all. And let me know when you're done."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Maybe then we could get a selfie?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,"Too busy, Morty. Now tell me about this summit."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Ugh. This sucks.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"God, tell me about it."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Oh, man. If you're not into it..."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,What do you mean?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"You're into lame stuff, Morty. I thought young dumb people considered it an honor to work for presidents or whatever the sh1t."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Maybe the first few times, but this just sucks."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,He treats us like Ghostbusters.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,We should talk to him.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Yeah, that sounds fun."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Third choice...
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,You like it now?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Got to be honest, Morty. It's growing on me."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,You can use that wood to make a chest.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Oh, good. Then I can store all this wood I'll need later for chest-making."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Okay. You're not going to have fun if you analyze everything.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,This is what they'd rather do?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Is this game popular with autistic people?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Why would you say something like that?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,'Cause I'm starting to love it.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Yello?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Fingers crossed, a month, yeah."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,You lying dicks! I see your asses playing "Minecraft"! I got you on satellite!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"I mean, what doesn't look bad through an illegal spy satellite?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,"Don't high-road me. The two of you break 1,000 federal laws a day."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,"And, yes, yes, yes, yes, you save the world now and then. America returns that favor by not holding the two of you accountable to its laws."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Well, it's nobody's fault."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Yeah. I mean, the way we see it, when we show up, that's the favor to you."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"As for the reason you've never, like, arrested us, we assumed you just knew that it was impossible, like, if you tried. You know, it wouldn't go well."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,Wouldn't go well? Can you elaborate?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"I think one of your 1,000 laws says, no, I can't elaborate."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,"Yes. Thank you, gentlemen."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"I told you, man!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"I'm impressed, Morty."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,"Our policy is, we never needed them and never will again. Today, we celebrate our independence from Rick and Morty. Everyone out."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Summer,I just put it on for fun. I know I can't buy it.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Oh, come on. You look great! You're only young once. Just promise, if the results are too strong, you'll use protection."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Summer,Really?! Thanks! When did you get rad?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,I don't know. Maybe I adjusted to the divorce and everything's new.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Summer,I'll say. I couldn't stand you for more than an hour at a time before.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,Yeah. Different person.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"How do you like that, Morty?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Whoa!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Just like "Minecraft"!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,What about this?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"South Park did it 4 years ago, Morty."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,They're fast.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Or we're slow.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Don't do it, guys."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,"Oh. Hello, Rick. You're here, too. I guess this is a global crisis."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Oh, God. Mr. President, Morty and I have the situation covered."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,I'm sure you did. Dismissed.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Dismissed?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,"Yeah, dismissed. Not needed here. You can leave and nobody will care. Have you never heard that before?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Do you even know how to take out this kind of threat?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,We're not taking it out. We're going to shrink down and approach them diplomatically.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,You shrink with pills?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Are you still here? Shouldn't you be going down to your next version of Earth with your selfie-craving star-fucker sidekick?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Whoa!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,We're allowed to be here. You aren't president of the Amazon.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Yeah, I learned about your job in school. You're a civil servant. We're technically your boss."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Oh, please, Morty. You pay as many taxes as you have pubes."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Oh, I got pubes, Commander-in-Queef. You want to count them?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Commander-in-Queef.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,That's it! Do it!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,You mean you've been ordering other people to prepare for it while you sat on your ass at peace summits.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Peace summits are important!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Oh, yeah! They work great! We're really drowning in peace!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,You suck!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,You suck!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Is there a Task Force Alpha health plan, by the way? Because if those pills are based on subatomic compression, you could get a more curable cancer just walking through the mushroom clouds."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,God damn it! i'll do it.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Task Force Alpha is disbanded.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Painful to watch. Oh, such lame shrinking."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Oh, his clothes stay the same size?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Eat my shrinking ass!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,There he goes. All right.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Let's get out of here, Morty."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"I made Sanchez-eum up, dumbasses.Don't believe everything you read on Wikipedia."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Oh! Run, Morty! That part was true!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"I-I can't talk now, sweetie."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Oh, when can you?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Good point.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,What's up?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Remember a little while ago when you said that, if I wanted, I could, like, leave Earth and wander the infinite cosmos to figure out who I am and that nobody would ever know I'd left because you could replace me with a clone?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Mm-hmm.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,Am I the clone?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Sorry. What?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Am I the clone? Did the real me choose to leave, and I only think I chose to stay because that's what I need to think because I'm the replacement Beth?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,No.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Okay. And one more thing. If I were a clone, would you tell me?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Beth, you know, when....When smart people get happy, they stop recognizing themselves. And you are very smart because you're very much my daughter."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Oh, God. You're right.' I'm sorry."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,All good?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"And just to be sure, you're not pretending to be convinced you're real because you're actually convinced you're a clone and you're now terrified that becoming self-aware would mean I'd have to terminate you?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,No.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Okay. Glad I could help.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,Aaaaaah!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Where do I go?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Then say that, God damn it! Sorry."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Madam Presidentress, I'm President of America, which is basically the world, but you didn't hear that from me. I've come to..."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Are there pants?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,What?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"It was Rick and Morty, you f*cking dunce!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Mr President,Because they're assholes!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"God damn it! They're right here! They're here, God damn it!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Everybody relax. Just waiting for you in the only room you can't blow up or spy on. So, we're not changing timelines for you, but now you have everything you want, so you can forget we exist, and we'll return the favor."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,You couldn't say that in a text?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Well, since we won't be seeing each other again, my... Guys, we get it. It's a Code Red. Enough. My grandson has worked hard for you, and I feel like he's earned a selfie."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Honestly, I could take it or leave it at this point."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,You're taking it.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,No. What kind of fratty-ass status move is that? Get out of my office!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Seriously? You're that stubborn?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,He's the stubborn one. I'm protecting my country.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Uh, from selfies?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,From subordination to hostile powers.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Uh, does China know about that deal-breaker?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,China doesn't piss on the White House.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Well, why would they? I'm sure it was expensive."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Get out.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Not without a selfie.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Arrest them. Son,"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"You have a right to refuse his order, and I guarantee you're going to die if you touch me, and there's no afterlife. Everything just goes black. Don't do it."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,What was that?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Death.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,What kind?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Instant.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,There was no sound. He just died.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Yeah, terrifying. It's a terrifying thing to watch happen. It's called a deterrent."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,How is knocking out a deterrent? Everyone wants to be knocked out. Nobody wants to be dead.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,You committed murder in the Oval Office. Now you can't leave.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,That's fine. I said I'm not leaving without a selfie.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Uh, I don't need a selfie."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,And I'm saying you aren't getting one and you aren't leaving.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,So we agree?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Yes. No. We disagree because you think you're getting a selfie and leaving.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Am I getting a selfie?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Never.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Then I'm never leaving.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Exactly.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Yes, nine people. I can show you. But I wouldn't recommend..."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"God, you are dumb!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Bad idea.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Wait. Why?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Because if there isn't someone in here that they're not supposed to kill, they're going to wreck the place trying to kill me. As long as you live, no matter where you are, if it isn't in a selfie with him, I'll be here."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,You don't know what I am! And you don't know what I can do!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"It's... It's cool, Rick!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,I'm Doctor Who in this mother Fucker! I could be a clone. I could be a hologram. We could be clones controlled by robots controlled with special headsets that the real Rick and Morty are wearing while they're f*cking your mother!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Then come to 312 Olive Street!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,You don't know because you're a bad son!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,Beth?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"My dad might have cloned me, and I might be the clone. And he says I'm not, but that's what he'd say to a clone."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,Typical.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"What are you, an idiot?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,"Well, don't knock intelligence, because right now I'd love to understand how I can help you."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,Okay. Sit down. Now cross your legs. That leg on top. Good.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Oh, what is this?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,"Senior year, I took you on a date to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra performing the music of Alan Silvestri in the Park. At this point in the song from ""Volcano,"" when Tommy Lee Jones and the utility workers are using cars to guide the lava into a cul-de-sac, I realized my palms were so sweaty, I would never get to hold your hand. But I was desperate to touch you, so I wiped my palm on the grass next to me. But a Snickers wrapper kind of got stuck on it, so I started kind of jiggling it, whipping it without moving too much. But you started looking over, and I thought, ""Well, this is it. She's going to see that I'm a loser,"" and I'll never get to touch her. ""But I still have time to touch her."" But my hand had Snickers on it, and the brass section was swelling because it was the scene with the guy melting in the lava. And I just thought, ""f*ck it."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Then that settles it, because my memory is of hating that night. But now, reliving it, all I can feel is how lucky I am to be loved by such a simple, honest, simple man."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,Simple twice.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,"Uh... well, vive la diff?'rence."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,You have the right to get the f*ck out of my office!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,You have the right to kiss my dick!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,I yield! I yield! Take the selfie!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Okay. Morty, get in there and say, ""Cheese."" Morty?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Rick, don't get mad, but I-I stole your portal gun."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"What the fuck, Morty?!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"I told you I didn't want the damn selfie 800 times! Look, whatever the hell is going on between you and the president, it's got nothing to do with me."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,So where did you go?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,I can't tell you.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,No! I told her she wasn't!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Well, isn't that what you'd tell a clone?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Oh, for Christ's sake."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Rick, my mom and dad are getting back together."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"Well, she says it doesn't matter if she is or isn't because now she loves my dad, and she wanted me and Summer to come home, and we're hiding from you so you don't kill her if she's a clone in a place I picked that you will never find."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Come on, bitch!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Oh, you come on, bitch."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"So I win. Then I'm in charge, and you can't leave. You're a terrorist. You're an enemy of the state, and you kicked me in the balls 10 minutes ago!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Mr. President, I'll make you a deal. If you let me use your ghetto-ass off-brand deficit-tripling teleporter, I can go take care of something, and you'll never see me again."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Yes. Deal.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"You know I could see them this whole time, right?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,"Don't push it, Sanchez."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,He found us!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Summer,I told you we shouldn't have gone to the same cabin as last time!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Oh, we're not going anywhere. This ends now. Dad, if you're my dad. Of course, you're not my dad. You're here with a gun because I am a clone. I guess I have all your daughter's memories. So I guess I was her, which makes me related to her. But I don't relate to her. She left her family and me, which means I relate to them. So if you kill me, fine. You're not killing her. But you're killing a real family. And instead of doing that, will you just go away?Aren't there, like, infinite time lines? Can't you just move to one where I don't know I'm a clone and where a different but identical version of your authentic sociopathic crazy bitch of a daughter can keep making you proud by being somewhere else?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Beth, you crazy bitch. You're my daughter. I brought this here to kill Jerry."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Oh, my God!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,Jesus Christ!
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You win, Jerry. You win! No amount of genius can stop your dumb mediocre vacuous roots from digging into everything and everyone around you and draining them of any ability to fend you off."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,"Well, it couldn't have been easy for you to say that. I appreciate it."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Morty, where's my portal gun? Let's get out of here."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,"I'm staying here, Rick."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,Are you... Ugh! Nobody gets it. Nothing you think matters matters. This isn't special. This... This is happening infinite times across infinite realities.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Summer,Including this?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Yes! Which is not to say that, subjectively, it wasn't funny."
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Morty,Are you going to stay?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"There's infinite time lines, Morty. Why would I stay in the one where I trashed the White House, became an enemy of America and the lowest-status character in my idiot family?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Summer,Because of the fart?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,There's still some rubble over there.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Hi, Mr. President. I'm Rick Sanchez, but not the one that did this. We Ricks travel the infinite and switch places with each other like hermit crabs, I think. I'm fly-fishing Rick. You can distinguish me from the Rick that you had a falling-out with by my fly-fishing enthusiasm and accompanying hat. I hope I can be of service if, uh, you ever find the planet to be in danger. Friends?"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,President,Sounds good to me.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,"Kids, dinner! I got Panda Express!"
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Summer,Did you get sugar chicken?
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,That's kind of the only thing they have.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Jerry,I'm hoping to get a piece of your sugar chicken later.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Beth,Stop it.
3,The Rickchurian Mortydate,Rick,"Here's your  stupid hat, dipshit."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,"Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,"*gives a thumbs-up* Ready as I?'ll ever be, Rick!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,"Oh, for fuck?'s sake."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick K-22,"*holding clipboard* Hello, I?'m Rick K-22. This is my Morty.  We?'re going from reality to reality, asking Ricks to contribute to the Citadel of Ricks redevelopment fund."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,"What are you, stupid? We?'re done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was *burp* never on board with it in the first place, that?'s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick K-22,*examines clipboard* Ohhh. That was you. *passes clipboard to his Morty*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,They tried to murder him first.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty K-22,"Oh geez. Well, you?'ll be happy to know that... the Council?'s gone now."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,"Yeah, he knows. He murdered them."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick K-22,You wanna rein in your Morty?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,*glaring* Every day.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty K-22,*reading from script* The Citadel of Ricks redevelopment fund donates--
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick K-22,"*interrupts* Morty, he?'s not gonna *belch* donate. You?'re pitching the policeman?'s ball to a black teenager here. *pulls out his portal gun and shoots a new portal* Let?'s go."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,You don?'t have to be a dick.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick K-22,I think you know that?'s not true.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,Geez. I didn?'t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,"*straps harpoon gun to his back* Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis. *shoots a portal* Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,Man. Glad I?'m not one of them!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,Citadel Morning News: News about the Citadel in the morning. Pretty self explanatory.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716-B,Good morning. I?'m Rick D716-B.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,And I?'m Rick D716.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716-B,Must be nice.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,Coming up! Gravity outages in East Sanchez Heights!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716-B,"And, is your uranium-powered cellular matrix making you sick? The answer may not surprise you. It?'s ??yes, it?'s uranium.??"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,Those stories and more after this break.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,"Sixteen iterations off the central finite curve, there?'s a Rick that works more with wood than polarity plating."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,"His name is Simple Rick, but he?'s no dummy."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,He realized long ago that the greatest thing he?'d ever create was his daughter.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Young Beth,I love Daddy!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple Rick?'s mind.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,And the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Rick?'s Simple Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick?'s.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,Just one day remains before our newly democratic Citadel elects its first president. It?'s anyone?'s race among the Rick candidates.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716-B,But a certain other candidate should be getting at least one vote for most adorable.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,"That?'s right, the Morty Party candidate?'s still in the race, and you just gotta love him for that."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,"Here you see him in his little Morty suit, waving. Isn?'t that adorable? Little jackass."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716-B,"Uh, yeah, I think we actually have the audio for his speech here. ??Aw geez, aw man, I?'m gonna lose the election and stuff.??"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,"We had a good run, sir, but I think it?'s time to pull out of the race."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,I feel pretty confident about tonight?'s debate.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,"You shouldn?'t, sir. You should be terrified."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"Maybe you should find a little faith, young man."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,You don?'t pay me to have faith! And we?'re the same age!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting--"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"A Rick partner? Lesson one, rookie: expect the unexpected. Now get in."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,Mortys are human!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Get the fuck off the car, you Rickless fuckin?? animal!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,WHOA!!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,The election?'s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"That?'s pretty harsh, sir."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,So report me. Nobody gives a fuck.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"Look, I?'m just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys ??animals??."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Well, it makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"Well, I?'m glad to know there?'s more like me."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Dispatch,Robbery at Fifth and *BURP* Avenue.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Fifth and *BURP*? That?'s Mortytown.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,Unit 7 responding.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,"""Good idea, Rick."""
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Students,"Good idea, Rick."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,"""This is a great adventure."""
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Students,This is a great adventure.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,"""I love being your new Morty."""
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Students,I love being your new Mor...
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,Farty!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,"Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.  Or was that your third Rick? How many Ricks have you had?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,Five??
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,"I see. So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully, they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Morty?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Tall Morty,Di-Did I gragitate this time yet?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,"Anything?'s possible, Tall Morty. Ugh??"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,"Guess we won?'t be seein?? each other after this, huh?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,I say we make our last day count. I say?? we go to the Wishing Portal.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,That?'s a myth.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Fat Morty,It?'s not a myth! M-m-my first Rick?'s fourth Morty knew a Rick whose Morty went there.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,"If we?'re not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in Mortytown."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,"I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,"Okay, fine. I?'m in."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,Me too.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Fat Morty,What the hell?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,*retracts tongue* I-I thought I saw a fly.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Supervisor Rick,"*whistles* Listen up, fucknuts! I?'ve been your supervisor for five years but all shitty things must come to an end, and I have been promoted to regional manager.  Yeah, I feel the same way. May we never meet again. Of course that makes the position of Supervisor available.  So as of next week, the ass you?'ll be kissing will be that of??  K-83,  affectionately known as ??Cool Rick.??"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cool Rick,"I know I?'m new to the Citadel and some of you might not think I?'ve put in my time, but what can I say? I?'m Cool Rick! *finger guns* Yo, ha-ha-ha, check me out!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Supervisor Rick,"Alright, knuckle-*burp*-heads, any questions?  Alright then, back to work, you gold-Rickers."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"No Ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin?? amok. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin??."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty Mart Morty,"They were, they were about my height, around fourteen years old?? OH! Their shirts were yellow!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"*sarcastically* Yeah, make sure you get that down."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty Mart Morty,"No, just four normal Mortys."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Purple Trunk Morty,*feels annoyed* "Normal"?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty Mart Morty,*talks back to Purple Morty* Put it in your blog.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,*looking at two Mortys in a nearby alley* Lemme turn over a few rocks.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Aw geez, hey, what?'s goin?? on, fellas?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty 1,"Aw geez, man, nothin?? man, we?'re just hangin?? out and stuff."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"I hear that, ah geez, I guess I?'m supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty 2,"*smirking* Ah geez man, that sucks that your Rick?'s makin?? you do that."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"*angered* He?'s not my Rick. He?'s my partner. Aw, geez."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty 1,"Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME! CALL ME A SIDEKICK!!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty 2,"Hey man! C?'mon, aw geez!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty 2,"It was the Mortytown Locos, man! The Mortytown Locos!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Do you realize how many codes you just violated?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Aw geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin?? stuff? Get in the fucking car."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Retired General Rick,More lasers.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Moderator Rick,You can take more time to answer the question if you?'d like.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Moderator Rick,"...Okay, Juggling Rick. How would you solve the Citadel?'s financial crisis?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Juggling Rick,"First off, can I just say that I think this Citadel is the greatest in the entire multiverse. Now, I believe the answer to your question has three parts.  First, education spending must get muuuch higher! *starts tossing one ball*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Juggling Rick,But it has to be balanced with defense! *starts juggling all three balls* Whoa!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,"Can we fact-check this, please? Never mind, who am I kidding? This race is over."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Juggling Rick,"*now juggling three balls and a chainsaw, he catches them all gracefully* And that?'s how you run a Citadel. *bows*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Moderator Rick,"Candidate Morty. The number of displaced Mortys is soaring, while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting, and the divide between the two groups has never been wider. *smirks* Solve that one real quick."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,I don?'t see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Retired General Rick,"Oh, shocker. *farts*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Reverse Rick Outrage,I?'d like to offer a rebuttal. *farts*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick Guilt Rick,"Gentlemen, gentlemen! I think we can all agree on one thing. *farts twice* Well, came out as two things, but you get the idea."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"You guys finished?  The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys we?'re all the same because they?'re threatened by what makes us unique."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so we?'re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss?'s salary, even though they?'re identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel?'s problem isn?'t homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,The Citadel?'s problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadel?'s debt.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,Holy shit.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick Worker,He's headed for the Flavor Core!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"But I?'ve got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message?? from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that don?'t: you are outnumbered!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,Holy shit.  I don?'t believe it! I-I can?'t believe it!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,I know. *puts a hand on his shoulder* That?'s why you?'re fired. *walks away*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Juggling Rick,"Sounds like you?'re looking for work. I can offer you a very enticing compensation package. *sets down bag and unzips it, pulling out three juggling clubs* First, let?'s talk benefits."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Simple Rick,*mumbling to self* Daddy loves you?? That?'s Daddy?'s good girl.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,"*to Simple Rick* Your life is a lie, man. *to police* All your lives are lies! Don?'t you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Negotiator Rick,"*through megaphone* We know how you feel. We?'re working stiff Ricks just like you, but our assembly line is justice. What are your demands?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,"*burp* I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,SWAT Team Rick,The media?'s outside.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Negotiator Rick,"Well, keep ?'em there!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716-C,"Anyway, so yeah, the suspect says the Citadel is a lie, built on lies, and some other shit.  I say, appreciate the life you have, because it can always be worse. Back to you, Ricks."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,"Thank you, Rick 716-C. *mumbling to D716-B* That fuckin?? guy."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716-B,Tell me about it.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D716,"Ahem. Meanwhile, in election news, an unexpected turn of events as Morty from the Morty Party soars to the top of the polls."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,Yes?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Reporter Rick,Morty! What?'s your original reality and where?'s your Rick?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,Gosh. We moved around so much it?'s hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,I hope they see me as their Morty.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,"*holding glass* Another, please, with less water."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bartender Morty,"*fixing a new drink* Hey, cheer up, pal! A Morty?'s gonna be president. *gestures to TV* Imagine this kisser gettin?? blamed for everything!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,I guess I shoulda had more faith.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Investigator Rick,It?'s not faith you need. It?'s fear.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,What?'s this?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Investigator Rick,*drains his glass* It?'s secrets. Wh-wh-what do you think it is? *Gets up and walks away* Look at how I?'m dressed.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick Reporter,"Taking on the system like this, are you afraid at all for your safety?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"I?'d rather live in hope than fear.  If I had to fear anything, I?'d fear other people being afraid. Of fear. Itself."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"But no, I?'m not afraid."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Mortytown Loco,"Hey Rick, man, when there?'s a Morty president, you gonna lick my balls or what?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bootleg Rick,"Shit, grandson, you keep me peelin?? squap-squams and slippin?? nib-nibs I?'ll lick whatever ain?'t nailed down."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Hands in the air!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Mortytown Loco,"What the hell, man? What the hell in hell?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,You guys doin?? a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Is this what I think it is?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,Bootleg portal fluid.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,Guess his math was off. Search the place.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Psychopath Morty,A-Are you?? m-my new?? Rick?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"It?'s okay, Morty."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,Jesus!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"He stabbed me! He got me bad, Morty."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"*approaches Rick and kneels down beside him* Shh, it?'s okay, you?'re okay."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,You were right?? *cough* Everything I learned in the academy was--
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,It doesn?'t matter. *helps Rick to his feet* Nothing?'s wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Why is there a crib in here?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,Just somethin?? they do to make you feel bad.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,What happened?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,Same old story. Mortys killing Mortys.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,Almost... got it...
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Farmer Rick,"Hey, y'all get the hell away from my damn Megafruit!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Farmer Rick,"Sic 'em, boy! *his robot dog gives chase; the four Mortys tumble down into a river* I don't wear this dangnap hat and commit to this rural character so you can eat for free while you come of age!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Fat Morty,I bet the Wishing Portal leads to a reality where there... where all... where it's a bunch of French toast with boobies.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,I bet it leads to a place where a bunch of fri-- flies everywhere! *Slick feels peevish*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,"Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it's a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Fat Morty,"Slick, why do ya have to be so dramatic?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,"*stands up* You wanna know why? *lifts his shirt to reveal a large barcode on his abdomen* Because of this! I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys with a trauma implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Morty, to know that no matter where I go, *Glasses Morty comes over to Slick as he sits back down feeling depressed* I'll always be the one that makes everybody sad and... a little bored? *Glasses Morty consoles Slick*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,"Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay? You also roll up your sleeves. *they hug each other*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Fat Morty,I thought I was Left-Handed Morty.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,Hey there. How you doing? Great to meet you. *greets a Plumber Rick*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Plumber Rick,"I'm a plumber, sir! I-I'm a Rick and I'm a plumber!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,"That doesn't sound like Rick work. You didn't come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Plumber Rick,"*laughs joyfully* I sure didn't, sir! *a blueshirt Rick carrying a Rick baby comes next to Plumber Rick*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Father Rick,"Mr. Morty, Mr. Morty! *gives his baby Rick to him* I cloned myself so you can kiss me as a baby!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,This is just like a Morty baby!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,Hey! *they shake hands* Did you end up getting a new job?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,"Yeah, I did. Assassinating you!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Candidate Morty,I'm okay... I'm okay... I'm... *falls unconscious* Ohh...
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Builder Hat Morty,"You look like you could use a good time! One dance for 10, two for 25!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"No thank you, and bad math. *see Bearded Morty enjoying Jeans Shorts Morty dancing*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bearded Morty,"Ha-ha, yeah! This is a good time!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,What is the place?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"""The Creepy Morty"". What is it your kind's always saying? ""Don't think about it."" Come on. There's someone important I want you to meet."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Big Morty,"Ah, Bubblah! How'd it go with the Mortytown Locos?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,They had a little accident. They won't be causing any trouble anymore.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Big Morty,"Those were bad Mortys. Very bad Mortys. *snaps his finger, Morty Bouncer 2 gives an envelope to Cop Morty*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Big Morty likes to contribute to keeping the peace in Mortytown. *takes out a wad of dollar bills* Think of him as a drug lord, and us his cops on his payroll. *throws bills to Cop Rick*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Morty...
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty Bouncers/Cop Morty,*all said at once* Which Morty?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"M-m-my partner. Morty, you're right. Mortytown is bad, but that doesn't mean that we have to be. *Cop Morty is shocked*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Big Morty,"Hey, what's goin' on here, Morty?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty Bouncers,*both said at once* Which Morty?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Big Morty,"The cop, morons."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"*nervously* Don't worry about Rick, Big Morty. He's new. He doesn't understand how it works."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Big Morty,That's what you said about your last partner. *Cop Rick feels suspicious about this*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Wh-why would you say something like that, Big Morty? You're fucking things up for both of us here!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Big Morty,Wrong. He's fucking things up for both of you. Unless he takes the money. *both Morty Bouncers and Cop Morty stare at Cop Rick sceptically for a beat; Cop Rick turns to Big Morty*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"Big Morty, you're under arrest. *both Morty Bouncers take out their laser pistols*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,S-smartest man in the universe.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cowboy Morty,*drops his cowboy pistols* They're just props! Th-they're just props!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Not so big now, are ya?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Big Morty,I never was! It was figurative! *Cop Rick aims at Cop Morty*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,That's enough!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"If we don't kill him, he'll talk!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"If you do, I'll talk. *Cowboy Morty talks out to the group by the strip pole*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cowboy Morty,"One thing's for sure: y-y'all don't have to worry about Cowboy Morty talkin'! This little cowpoke's gonna mosey up on outta here! *walks away, Cop Rick turns to Cop Morty*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,"You told me to put my faith in the right Morty. I got faith in you, partner. Do the right thing. *Cop Morty pauses for a beat, starts crying tears down his face*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Morty,"Oh, Grandpa Rick! I don't wanna be on the Citadel anymore! I want to be a regular kid! I want to go to school and throw balls around and masturbate!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick 2,The hell happened in there?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Same old story. Ricks killing Mortys.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Negotiator Rick,"Okay, man, okay! We got your portal gun."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Negotiator Rick,The hell's he doing? *Rick J-22 first removes the pink tube connecting behind the headgear and throws the headgear off of Simple Rick; he wakes up immediately*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Simple Rick,Wh-where am I?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,"A bad place, but you're going to a better one soon."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,SWAT Team Rick 1,*bangs other side of window* Hey! Hey! *Rick J-22 fires a portal next to Simple Rick*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Negotiator Rick,"No, no, no, no--!! *Rick J-22 pushes Simple Rick into the portal and is instantly blended with a geyser of blood* Goddammit!!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,A portal to the Blender Dimension?! That's the oldest trick in the book! I'm a Rick! I'm more Rick than any of you!!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Negotiator Rick,Then you should know you just killed your only leverage!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,"Then come and get me, motherfuckers!!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Purple Suit Rick,"Stop! *he wears a purple suit with green under shirt and green tie, purple top hat, and carries a gold cane* I'm Rick D. Sanchez III, owner of this here wafer establishment, and I say that the Rick in there is right! He's more Rick than any of you."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,SWAT Team Rick 2,He's a terrorist!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D. Sanchez III,"What Rick isn't? *walks into the chamber to greet Rick J-22* The Citadel was founded by Ricks for Ricks to be free. *taps Rick J-22's head with his cane* What's your name, young man?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,Rick. And I'm--
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D. Sanchez III,"Same age as me, I know. How long have worked here?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,Fifteen years.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D. Sanchez III,"What the hell have we become? *turns to the SWAT Team Ricks* Whatever time you were going to make him serve, he served it. It ends now! *walks up to Rick J-22* Come with me, friend."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick J-22,Where are we going?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D. Sanchez III,"To your new life, which starts with walking the fuck out of here."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick Worker,"Yo, J-22! Give 'em hell!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,"There's a Rick who held a factory hostage after murdering his boss and several co-workers. The factory made cookies, flavored him with lies."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,"He made us all take a look at what we were doing, and at the bargain he got a taste of real freedom."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Narrator,"We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him so he can give it right back to you, in every bite of new Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects. *shows wafer displayed on screen* Come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to Simple Rick."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Fat Morty,It is real! *Slick breaks the lock with a lead pipe and the gates open*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,After you. *the four Mortys walk through the gate. Slick drops his pipe along the way*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Fat Morty,"There it is... the Wishing Portal. They say for your wish to come true, y-you have to give up something really important. *takes a food machine out of his bag* For me, that's my panini maker. I wish for a million sandwiches! *drops his panini maker down the portal. He turns back to Lizard Morty* And yes, I see the irony."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,I guess I wish I had something cooler than this dumbass surfer necklace. *throws necklace into portal; Glasses takes out a candy bar*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,"I wish incest porn h-had a more mainstream appeal, f-for a friend of mine. *Slick takes a step forward, feeling withdrawn*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,"None of those things are gonna happen, y'know. Morty wishes never come true. Not on the Citadel."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,Then why did you bring us here?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,Because I wish that would change. I wish anything about this life would change.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,"Well, I hope you're putting something pretty goddamn important in there."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Slick,"Me, too. But I doubt it. *throws himself into the portal; Glasses and Lizard scream in shock*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,NOOOOOOOO!!!!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,SLI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ICK!!!!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,Maybe... Maybe he went somewhere nice.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick PA Announcer,*via speaker* "Garbage dump. Stand *burp* back." *the three large pipes dump several amounts of garbage into the portal*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,*gets himself up* He gotta be stopped... *wipes bloodstain off his face* He-he cou-couldn't be allowed to win.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bodyguard Rick 1,"Then you should've *burp* worked on your aim, bro."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,"He's alive?! No, no, no! You gotta listen to me! *shows his campaign badge* I-I worked for him! I was his campaign manager! That Morty is not what he seems."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bodyguard Rick 2,"Yeah, well, no Morty seems like a president."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Campaign Manager Morty,He... won?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bodyguard Rick 2,Yeah. *the airlock door closes; Campaign Manager Morty immediately brings out the documents and cries out to the Bodyguard Ricks but to no avail*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bodyguard Rick 1,It was a blowout. *pushes button on airlock panel and Campaign Manager Morty is instantly sucked out into space along with the dossier and its contents*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bodyguard Rick 2,"We hardly call it a blowout, it was almost close enough to trigger a recount."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Bodyguard Rick 1,"Jesus, what are you, joke security now, too?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,Why am I still here? I already confessed to everything.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Officer Rick 1,"Your case has been reviewed. *presses button, unlocks Cop Rick's handcuffs* You're free to go."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Cop Rick,But... I violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Officer Rick 1,New department. New codes. *leaves room*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Officer Rick 2,New Citadel. *leaves with Officer Rick 1*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Ricks?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,No graduation. No new Ricks. The school's curriculum is changing.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Glasses Morty,To what?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Teacher Rick,"I don't know, and I don't have to know. I've been fired. *takes out a flask, unscrews top and walks off* Good luck, turds."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Lizard Morty,Holy crap... Slick's wish came true. *sees Glasses and Fat Morty smiling*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick D. Sanchez III,"Sorry I'm late, Mr. President. Had a little crisis at work."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Steve Jobs Rick,Worth it! *eats Simple Rick wafer cookie; see President Morty having a haircut with Barber Rick*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,President Morty,"It's no problem. *to Barber Rick* Uh, a little more off the top. *continues* You were saying, Garment District Rick?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Garment District Rick,"We were saying, *air-quotes* ""President Morty,"" that we don't care who sits in that seat. A Rick, a Morty, a goddam Jerry, doesn't matter. We've been running the Citadel since before the Council, and you'll find that we're still running it now. *President Morty turns over holding a mirror*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,President Morty,Does he really speak for everyone here?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Other Ricks,"Yeah, yeah. *President Morty turns back again holding up the mirror*"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,President Morty,"Well, I think it's important to be clear. Raise your hand if he speaks for you."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Barber Rick,*keeping his cool* Is that... enough off the top? *three more Officer Ricks enter*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,President Morty,I don't know. *turns over the two remaining Ricks* Is it?
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Steve Jobs Rick,"*begging* Yes, yes, yes! Goddamn yes!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Good-Looking Rick,"*begging* Yes, it's great!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,President Morty,Good.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,President Morty,"This seems like a good time for a drink, and a cold, calculated speech with sinister overtones. A speech about politics, about order, brotherhood, power..."
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,President Morty,But speeches are for campaigning. *looks into his glass of brandy and gives a sinister expression* Now... is the time for action.
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,"Whoa!! Hahaha, yeah! Atlantis, baby!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,That was amazing! *both take off their snorkels and flippers*
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,Got some of that mermaid puss!
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,"I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Rick,"*takes seaweed off his pants* Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!"
3,The Ricklantis Mixup,Morty,"*as Rick continues celebrating* Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Then I thought, ""Hey, what about Jerry? He's -- He's good with regular folk."" This is a real situation where -- where -- where Jerry could really shine. He's a master convincer."""
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Rick, I'm not an idiot. I know what this is."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty, ""Look, parents get divorced. They get sad. He'll be fine,"" but I think he's worried you're gonna, you know...Pbht! And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional. It impedes my work. So, I told him I'd take you out and give you a win."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,An execution.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,Geez! You really do need a win.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"So, you thought I was gonna drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out? And we're seeing how you'd act if that were about to happen? I mean, shit, I'll make you the pants right now. Take me two seconds to make you pants."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,I have pants at home!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Jerry, if I make pants, they'll be better than your pants at home. Also, if I wanted to kill you --"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Yeah, I get it. It would be amazing. Please, take me home. I'll tell my son we had an amazing adventure."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Well, if it's all the same, could we go get our story straight? Because you're a terrible liar."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,You called me a master convincer!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,You believed me?
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,Huh. This seems... kind of fancy.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Snoopy Bloopers,"Rick Sanchez. I told you if I ever saw your face in here again, I would stick you like the pig you are."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Shnoopy Bloopers, I told you if you tried... There'd be two funerals."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Beth,What's wrong?
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Summer,"Mom, do you think I'm hot?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Beth,I...don't think that's something that matters.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Summer,"So, I'm not hot?!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Beth,"Because I'm not an issue of Cosmo, okay? I'm your mother and a doctor, and --"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Morty,Geez.What?'s with her?
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Beth,Teenage-girl stuff.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,I'm gonna go take a leak.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Risotto,My name is Risotto Groupon. I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Do you have any comment cards, because I might have some thoughts."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Risotto,"My kingdom was usurped by force with weapons and technology supplied by your father-in-law! Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Risotto,"Then we are brothers, and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Wondered? Sure. I mean, I've wondered about having a v*g1n*."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,What? No! He's my wife's father.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Risotto,"Look, I'm not like Rick, so you're free to do as you please. But there comes a time in every man's life when he must choose the foundation on which his legacy will be built -- one of compromise or one of blood."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Morty,"Is that what this is about? L-Like, you want to prove yourself?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"The Whirly Dirly? All right, what's going on here? When did you get cool?!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,When you stole my wife!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,I should have done that a long time ago!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Morty,"But...if the machine was made by spider people, normal would mean eight legs."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"I got to hand it to you, Jerry. This was a solid idea."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,And you know what? I'll cop to it. I put a lot of strain on your marriage. It wasn't fair. I'm sorry.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,What?!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"I didn't respect your marriage. I certainly didn't do it any favors. And for what it's worth, I'll apologize to Beth for it when we get home. Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,Stop the ride! We got to get off.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"What are you talking about, buddy?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,We got to get out of this thing. We got to get out!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Jerry, what the --Oh shit!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Rick, up here! There's a spot where you can kill him!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Good call, Jerry! Hey, how'd you know about that?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"So, uh, Jerry, big fan of the Whirly Dirly, are you?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,Not anymore.  Obviously.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"But when you were, how did you know about it?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"It's a really common name. Now, take it easy, Rick. You've been in a serious roller-coaster crash. It's -- It's no time to be thinking about who did or didn't play a role in your attempted murder.  Get it off me! It's eating me! Look, I confess, okay? They told me about all the bad stuff you did to this planet and reminded me of all the bad stuff you did to me. But then you said you were sorry, and I realized you're not a monster -- not like this thing. fuck It's got me good. This is a mislead, right? You're inventing a thing to save me."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,I'm sorry. I-I made a mistake. I won't do it again!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,Nobody ever does.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"I took your family? Who do you think had more taken from them when you shot 20 ccs of liquid dream-killer into my daughter? She was Rick's daughter, Jerry. She had options!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Alien snake,Oof.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"That all ended because she felt sorry for you. You act like prey, but you're a predator! You use pity to lure in your victims! That's how you survive! I survive because I know everything. That snakes survives because children wander off, and you survive because people think, ""Oh, this poor piece of sh1t. He never gets a break. I can't stand the deafening silent wails of his wilting soul. I guess I'll hire him or marry him."""
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,Rick!  Rick! I knew you wouldn't let me die.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,That was never an option.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,Because you never had a son.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"No, because I need a living organism coated in gibble snake bile to attract a shmooglite runner."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Wait, what's happening?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Use that confusion, Jerry. It'll make you wriggle more like an abandoned newborn."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"There's a space port 20 miles south. We'll be able to board a galaxy class cruise ship and jump through a wormhole that will put us within spitting distance of the Milky Way. But, hey, it's about the journey, not the destination, right, Jerry?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Beth,"Just stay put, sweetie! Mom's still on hold."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,Obviously cookies.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,Let's get you the flakes then.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Okay, but it's not what I wanted."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Well, maybe next time, you won't be such a dumb piece of sh1t and you can pick for yourself."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,That's not nice.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,What's that? Did you just have a controversial thought?
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,No.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"That's what I thought, bitch. You little punk-ass."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Man #1,"All right, folks, if you could please take your seats, we're about to enter the wormhole."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,You're not killing us?
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Yeah, you're mean -- No offense."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,You might shoot me.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Woman,Temporal shield compromised.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Uh, that's okay! I'll leave! Please don't shoot. I-I'm the v*g1n* guy, remember?"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,Those aren't the questions you should be asking.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,I'm time! I'm literally time!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,All,Whooooa!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"I don't know, but it's enough time for a synaptic dampener to wear off."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,He hadn't decided he was still going to kill us!
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,He was talking himself into it. I've seen it before. Cosmic apotheosis wears off faster than salvia.
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"I'm starting to believe you because I just finished merging with your essence for an endless epoch, and I'm already back to thinking you're an asshole."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Wait, don't leave me!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Man #1,"All right, folks, you're free to get up and walk around the cabin and maybe take the wormhole out for breakfast."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Man #2,"Okay, you can do the dinner one or the breakfast one, but not both."
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Jerry,"Actually, I just realized, I don't have my wallet, and my bus pass is in there, so maybe --"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Rick,"Stay strong, Jerry. I believe in you!"
3,The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy,Together,No work talk!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,You got it.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Man, I told the money bugs. I said, ""You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Shoney's.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Relaxed enough?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"I admire you, Rick--"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,When I--
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Rick, here's--"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"You spoil us, Conroy."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,Ooh!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Yeah, well, tough titties."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Someone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she'll be there, too, won't she?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Fine, but I'm driving."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,You're right!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Where are we going?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film ""Mulan,"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Okay. All right, all right."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Is that--
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Me. I used to wear blue pants.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,I didn't. I did.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,What?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,And how are you gonna do that?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,What is this place? And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,That's my sister. This used to be my home.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,Sounds lonely.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Eh, pass."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"A different kind of Rick, I guess."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick ""I told ya so."" So, uh--"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What are you doing with that?!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,He's in prison.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Summer.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Boo-yah!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Boo-nah?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,Nooooooo!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Nope, they cannot."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Why not?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,It's a trap! Abort! We never left his --   No!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,A city of Grandpas?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Morty?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Grandpa Rick!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Duh!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,You're alive!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Rick!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"That's enough, Rick."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,R-Rick?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Why not shoot through her?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,What the fuck?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Because you love her!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,I hate you!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Not an issue, sweetie."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Ha!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Aww.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,The point is he thought I was going to.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"I totally did, by the way. You're a fucking moron, Morty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Morty, you fucking idiot!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Who's stupid now, bitch?!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Morty, we just got him back!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let's wrap this-"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,What?! What happened?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Oldest Rick trick in the book.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"""Fake gun, shoot me in standoff."" Brilliant."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Can't we just portal home?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Destroying the  galactic government.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Mr. Goldenfold,No longer will the insects have domain over surface world!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Jerry, what the hell is happening?!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,The galactic government collapsed.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Are you okay?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Just each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Guess who dismantled the government?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Please don't leave me again.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I never will, baby."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"No, you're right. Where's the vodka?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Beth, it's him or me!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Jerry's going to spend some time divorced.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,For everybody.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,For everybody.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, geez."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, fuck."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, man."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, man."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,You're gonna deny it.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Oh.
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that ""Mulan"" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What are you talking about?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Szechuan?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,McNuggets?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I want that ""Mulan"" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What the hell?
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"What are you talking about, Rick?"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What are you talking about?!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce."
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What is that?!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"For 97 more years, Morty!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What are you talking about?!
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!"
3,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Birdperson,I am Phoenixperson.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Morty.
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Morty!
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, Mooorty!"
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Morty?
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick? W-where are you?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"On my work bench, Morty."
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Flip the pickle over.
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge."
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,And?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"""And""? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?"
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Was it?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before"
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner."
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Well, can you move? Can you fly?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"All right, well, do pickles live forever or --"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle."
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Where are you guys going?
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez."
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Morty!
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never ""find a way"" to ""get out of"" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes."
3,Pickle Rick,Summer,Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?"
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Can't argue with that.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Great. We'll see you later.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, crap, that sun is bright."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God, moisture."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Oh! Oh!
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Come on. That's it.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Come get this delicious brine.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Yes!
3,Pickle Rick,Summer,How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class."
3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Temporarily. By order of the school.
3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?
3,Pickle Rick,Summer,We... have never... eaten poop.
3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,"Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to?"
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --"
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,He turned himself into a pickle.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"What? No, what kind of question is that?"
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which..."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Wow. Ugh.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important."
3,Pickle Rick,Summer,And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, he did not!"
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Do you really not see what's happening here?
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Tell me.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Fuck you.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Fuck both of you, too."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"God damn it, I love myself."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Pickle Riiick!
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Get that parkour. Get that parkour!
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,What is it?
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Where is it?
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?"
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Put him on, and locate the phone he's using."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out."
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Your mere presence in this building violates international law.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,You should know those men killed themselves.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,And how is that?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,They didn't  let me out.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Uh, is this not a good time or...?"
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,That'd be a lucky break for you.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Ah.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,He's just a pickle!
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,He's not the only one.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.
3,Pickle Rick,Summer,I never said I was angry at you.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say ""I'm angry at mommy"" out loud."
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Oh, my God!"
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,You admire him for that.
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,It's better than making your problems other people's problems.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, come on!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,You should know that isn't original.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Jaguar couldn't make it.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"No, thanks. I'm coming for you now."
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination."
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you."
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Jaguar's daughter is dead.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Huh, so you're a liar."
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,I don't think so. See you soon.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Is the helicopter here?
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Tell them we were robbed.
3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Farewell, Solen'ya."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Good. Summer, you go."
3,Pickle Rick,Summer,I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Good job. Morty, do you have an ""I"" statement?"
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Ugh.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,You must be Rick.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Mm-hmm.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,By changing you from a pickle to a human.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Yes.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?"
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,So I wouldn't have to come here.
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Why didn't you want to come here?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked."
3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever..."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist."
3,Pickle Rick,Summer,Are we gonna go back?
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?"
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony."
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Eh.
3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Weird breed.
3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on."
3,Pickle Rick,Rick,Absolutely.
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"I, I liked her."
3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?"
3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"Yeah, either one. Either one."
3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"You'll never get away with this, Concerto."
3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god."
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!"
3,Pickle Rick,Rick,Jaguar!
3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Who? Who was that, Rick?"
3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Then why aren't we killing them?!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Vindicators, Worldender is back..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"..and this time, he's out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,My balls.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Rick!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"...the Terraneus system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, stop!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing!  If I can continue, Rick. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Sorry I'm late. It was happy hour.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Happy hour.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Rick Huanhuan, Tinkerer of Terror. Man, that's hard to say. And... Morty, right?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Whoa, yeah!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators? Let's make this three for three?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Did he say "three for three"?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Did he say he never forgets a kid?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"You mean ""two for two"", right, Vance?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense... insecurity.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"We weren't here ""last time"", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts".
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Yeah, but not heroes."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, God."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Huanhuan to a more comfortable spot so that someone can...  clean up his diarrhea."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Vindicators, prepare for arrival."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning and I'm afraid we need to make a little change."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,You should be.  Running around in a yellow t-shirt like you're not one of us? Disgraceful.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I-I-I... I'm not a superhero.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Cop a squat, chief.  Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Rick says "good" and "bad" are artificial constructs.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.  Not coming, Noob-Noob?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Security drones, inbound."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Star Mother, grant me your wrath!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,All aboard!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Aah!  Gun turret.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Are you all right?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.  I am back to one million ants.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Someone wake up Huanhuan.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ugh! Oh, Christ..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Rick, you're up."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Barely.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Uh-huh.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, my God, that's better."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,RICK!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Hey, I can't help if I can't see."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I could've just used a ghost train.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Man, fuck you."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Get it yourself.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Just focus on the mission, all right?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Son of a steam engine! They're all dead!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,What the FUCK?!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,It's Worldender! What happened to him?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense his life force is fading.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,He's right. This is far from over.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Shit.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense the presence of a greater evil.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Rick? What's going on, buddy?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Obviously? You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it? That's something obvious to you?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"...So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, is-is this a ""Saw"" thing? Are you seriously ""Saw""-ing the Vindicators?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Morty I'm a drunk, not a hack."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in  ""Sawwww""."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you'll  all die."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Why are you acting like that's not you?!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,What part of "blackout" don't you understand? I thought you drank?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Vance, stay calm..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Oh, so you're the leader now because we gave you a jacket?! You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Okay, ouch, but..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Okay, this... this is triggering me. I need space. I-I need SPACE! FROM THIS!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Give me one good reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"And because, like I said, I don't remember last night."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Guys!  I've figured it out.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,Congrats! You did it-- it!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Let's just get through this as quickly as possible. Then, we'll deal with the two of you."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"That's not the issue, Rick!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"The Vindicators say their job is is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... pick the location you'll... you'll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Crocubot, don't!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Goddammit!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Nothing!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"W-Wait, huh?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Doomnomitron was hiding here! He's a shapeshifter! Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, o-okay. This again?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,I'm not the one that didn't want you back. Alan was!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Do not threaten her!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Congrats, you did it!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,What the hell is Is-ra-el?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I have no stake in this.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,"Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"let's say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don't know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Morty, how many of these...?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Too many, Rick! Too many!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Man, I am really getting high-roaded today."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,That's a three-pointer!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Nice shot.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Thank you.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,You two make quite a team.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,We all do.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Yeah, I guess."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,That's a three-pointer!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"I mean, really unspoken. Like, ""let's-not-tell-my-husband"" unspoken."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"We aren't married anymore, Alan."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Sure, but were we married when you two were ""stranded"" on Delphi 6 for three days? Because I sensed something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity? I'm just a phantom train conductor. You're the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,That's a three-pointer!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Where the fuck is the lead wire?!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Holy shit. You're jealous.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,YES! Is that what you want to hear?!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Did it feel good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,That's a three-pointer!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,WHAT?!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR! And yes, he was better than you!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Yeah?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,One million times better!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,STOP!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Oof! Didn't see that comin'.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Is that sarcasm?!  I don't want you slipping away then this is over! All of these deaths are on your hands!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,All of them.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,O-kayyy...
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Congrats, you did it!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"All right, buy now, I've been pretty clear that I thunk the Vindicators are  full of shit. But... you do have one thing I'll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"So what's the trick? Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,I could--It could be Morty.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,What?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying ""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."""
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,That is a... really specific guess.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,But you're betting our lives on it.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I'll cover that bet. I get it.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, shit."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Ugh, y-you're probably confused because we barely know each other..."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, ""Oh, the Vindicators are so cool."" I mean, he's a moron, it's their... demographic. But you're different, Noob-Noob."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,...Motherfucker!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Shut up.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense this means we are not drying.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Not all of us.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Sweetheart?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles. It's for the greater good."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Greater good?!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Titty-Bean?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"It's like you said, Morty"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Never said that!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Yeah, I feel safer already."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Right?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,"Titty-Bean, listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,When did it get so complicated?
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Who knows? But we can make it simple again.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,You were always the romantic.  Which is why you can't leave either.
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Goodbye, my love."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Silence! I'm going to enjoy this...
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Announcer,"Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Huanhuan for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Look at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, Supernova's getting away!"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ah, who cares?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,But.. she was trying to kill us!
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Beth,"Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?"
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Summer,"Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Shut up, Summer."
3,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,"Ready as Ill ever be, Rick!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Oh, for fucks sake."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"What are you, stupid? Were done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, thats why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,They tried to murder him first.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,"Yeah, he knows. He murdered them."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,Every day.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,You dont have to be a dick.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,Geez. I didnt know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,Man. Glad Im not one of them!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"Sixteen iterations off the central finite curve, theres a Rick that works more with wood than polarity plating."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"His name is Simple Rick, but hes no dummy."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,He realized long ago that the greatest thing hed ever create was his daughter.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple Ricks mind.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,And the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Ricks Simple Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Ricks.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"We had a good run, sir, but I think its time to pull out of the race."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I feel pretty confident about tonights debate.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"You shouldnt, sir. You should be terrified."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"Maybe you should find a little faith, young man."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,You dont pay me to have faith! And were the same age!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting--"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"A Rick partner? Lesson one, rookie"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,Mortys are human!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Get the fuck off the car, you Rickless fuckin animal!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,WHOA!!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,The elections got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Thats pretty harsh, sir."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,So report me. Nobody gives a fuck.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Look, Im just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys animals."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Well, it makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Well, Im glad to know theres more like me."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Fifth and ? Thats Mortytown.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Unit 7 responding.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"""Good idea, Rick."""
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"""This is a great adventure."""
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"""I love being your new Morty."""
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Farty!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.  Or was that your third Rick? How many Ricks have you had?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Five
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"I see. So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully, they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Morty?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"Anythings possible, Tall Morty. Ugh"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,"Guess we wont be seein each other after this, huh?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,I say we make our last day count. I say we go to the Wishing Portal.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,Thats a myth.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,"If were not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in Mortytown."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,"Okay, fine. Im in."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,Me too.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,I-I thought I saw a fly.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"No Ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin amok. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Yeah, make sure you get that down."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Lemme turn over a few rocks.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Aw geez, hey, whats goin on, fellas?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 1,"Aw geez, man, nothin man, were just hangin out and stuff."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"I hear that, ah geez, I guess Im supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 2,"Ah geez man, that sucks that your Ricks makin you do that."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Hes not my Rick. Hes my partner. Aw, geez."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 1,"Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME!?CALL ME A SIDEKICK!!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 2,"Hey man! Cmon, aw geez!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 2,"It was the Mortytown Locos, man! The Mortytown Locos!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Do you realize how many codes you just violated?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Aw geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin stuff? Get in the fucking car."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"Can we fact-check this, please? Never mind, who am I kidding? This race is over."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I dont see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"You guys finished?  The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys were all the same because theyre threatened by what makes us unique."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so were too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their bosss salary, even though theyre identical and have the same IQ. The Citadels problem isnt homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,The Citadels problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadels debt.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,Holy shit.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"But Ive got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that dont"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,Holy shit.  I dont believe it! I-I cant believe it!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I know.  Thats why youre fired.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"Your life is a lie, man.  All your lives are lies! Dont you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,Yes?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,Gosh. We moved around so much its hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I hope they see me as their Morty.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"Another, please, with less water."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,I guess I shoulda had more faith.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,Whats this?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Hands in the air!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,You guys doin a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Is this what I think it is?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Bootleg portal fluid.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Guess his math was off. Search the place.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Its okay, Morty."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Jesus!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"He stabbed me! He got me bad, Morty."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Shh, its okay, youre okay."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,You were right  Everything I learned in the academy was--
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,It doesnt matter.  Nothings wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Why is there a crib in here?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Just somethin they do to make you feel bad.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,What happened?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Same old story. Mortys killing Mortys.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,Almost... got it...
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,I bet it leads to a place where a bunch of fri-- flies everywhere!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it's a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"You wanna know why?  Because of this! I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys with a trauma implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Morty, to know that no matter where I go,  I'll always be the one that makes everybody sad and... a little bored?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,"Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay? You also roll up your sleeves."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,Hey there. How you doing? Great to meet you.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"That doesn't sound like Rick work. You didn't come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,This is just like a Morty baby!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,Hey!  Did you end up getting a new job?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"Yeah, I did. Assassinating you!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I'm okay... I'm okay... I'm...  Ohh...
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"No thank you, and bad math."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,What is the place?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"""The Creepy Morty"". What is it your kind's always saying? ""Don't think about it."" Come on. There's someone important I want you to meet."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,They had a little accident. They won't be causing any trouble anymore.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Big Morty likes to contribute to keeping the peace in Mortytown.  Think of him as a drug lord, and us his cops on his payroll."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Morty...
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"M-m-my partner. Morty, you're right. Mortytown is bad, but that doesn't mean that we have to be."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Don't worry about Rick, Big Morty. He's new. He doesn't understand how it works."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Wh-why would you say something like that, Big Morty? You're fucking things up for both of us here!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Big Morty, you're under arrest."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,S-smartest man in the universe.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Not so big now, are ya?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,That's enough!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"If we don't kill him, he'll talk!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"If you do, I'll talk."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"You told me to put my faith in the right Morty. I got faith in you, partner. Do the right thing."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Oh, Grandpa Rick! I don't wanna be on the Citadel anymore! I want to be a regular kid! I want to go to school and throw balls around and masturbate!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Same old story. Ricks killing Mortys.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"A bad place, but you're going to a better one soon."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,A portal to the Blender Dimension?! That's the oldest trick in the book! I'm a Rick! I'm more Rick than any of you!!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"Then come and get me, motherfuckers!!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,Rick. And I'm--
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,Fifteen years.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,Where are we going?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"There's a Rick who held a factory hostage after murdering his boss and several co-workers. The factory made cookies, flavored him with lies."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"He made us all take a look at what we were doing, and at the bargain he got a taste of real freedom."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him so he can give it right back to you, in every bite of new Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects.  Come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to Simple Rick."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,After you.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,I guess I wish I had something cooler than this dumbass surfer necklace.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,"I wish incest porn h-had a more mainstream appeal, f-for a friend of mine."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"None of those things are gonna happen, y'know. Morty wishes never come true. Not on the Citadel."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,Then why did you bring us here?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Because I wish that would change. I wish anything about this life would change.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,"Well, I hope you're putting something pretty goddamn important in there."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"Me, too. But I doubt it."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,NOOOOOOOO!!!!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,SLI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ICK!!!!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,Maybe... Maybe he went somewhere nice.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,He gotta be stopped...  He-he cou-couldn't be allowed to win.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"He's alive?! No, no, no! You gotta listen to me!  I-I worked for him! I was his campaign manager! That Morty is not what he seems."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,He... won?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Why am I still here? I already confessed to everything.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,But... I violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Ricks?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,No graduation. No new Ricks. The school's curriculum is changing.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,To what?
3,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"I don't know, and I don't have to know. I've been fired.  Good luck, turds."
3,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,Holy crap... Slick's wish came true.
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Whoa!! Hahaha, yeah! Atlantis, baby!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,That was amazing!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,Got some of that mermaid puss!
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,"I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!"
3,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,"Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit!"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,"Rick, we did it! W-we got it!"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Hurry up, Morty get in!"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,Chachi!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Fuck Chachi, Morty! Did you get it?"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,He helped me escape prison!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,Did you get the Ultimate Cube?
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Oh, it's purple."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,You said it was purple.
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"I said mine was, I didn't know they all were."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"And now we do, thanks to Chichi."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,Chachi!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,"So, uh...w-w-when do I get it?"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Get what, a hug? Let's find a planet with a garden hose first?"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,A dragon!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,A dragon?
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,"You asked me to cut class and fight robots with, I said no, you said millions of lives depend on it, I said I'll do it for a dragon, you said whatever, I want my dragon!"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds that refuse to admit they're Christian."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,I want my dragon!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Let me get you rocket shoes, l-let me get you Wolverine claws, let me get you a fucking rocket hat! Just make sure to use it with rocket shoes or it'll rip your head off."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,"I want my dragon, I want my dragon, I want my dragon?!"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,Oh crap. {coughs} Crap!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Beth,"Dad, are you okay? Your ship crashed in Malta."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,{grunts} I'm okay.
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Beth,"Oh, thank god."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Beth,"Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon?"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,AAAAAAARGH!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,Morty's on Jessica's Instagram again.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Get out of here, jerk!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,"What's so embarrassing, Morty? Sharing it with your family might help."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,"Summer, stop shaming your brother.  Morty, stop being a creepy, perverted cyberstalker."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,I'm not cyberstalking! I-I-I just wanted to know where she got this necklace from.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Hi. I've placed an auto-response chip in my brain so I can spend time with my family.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,But you are spending time with your family.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Uh...
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,Dad? There's a way we do this now.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Morty, would you please accompany me to Forbodulon Prime for death crystals?"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Well, thank you for asking. Yes, I will do that."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,It is a hot photo.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"You're thinking of bullets, Morty. Death crystals show you how you're gonna die."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Jesus Christ! I-I die a million times?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Your future stems from your  present, which, if you're living right, keeps changing. Truth is, anyone that knows how they're definitely gonna die is either boring as hell or about to get shit."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Crystal poachers.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,I will avenge my death.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Holy shit!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Just kidding. I'm a crisis detection and correction hologram generated by a chip that ""real"" Rick put in your spine. ""Real"" in quotes because calling density-privileged entities ""real"" is incredibly holo-phobic. Morty, do me a solid... problematic wordplay aside... grab the gun with the blue handle from the trunk and get a tissue sample from the corpse."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Alright, now take that to the trunk and insert it into the clone compiler. I see you appear to be holding a death crystal that's guiding your decisions more than I am. That's your right. I just want to remind you that some people can't hold anything and can never die, so that's a little offensive to..."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Then we'll get along fine, Fascist Morty."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Fascist Morty,You will go where I want you to go!!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go! Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Alright. Okay, regroup, everybody. You, too, Berkeley!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Here's an idea, Morty. Throw that thing in the garbage, stop planning your own death, and talk to whoever you want."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"You're better than that language, Morty."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"I ain't better than shit, Jack."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"No, it looks like this. It's, like, identical to this, actually."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Goddamnit! When did this shit become the default?!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Apparently, it doesn't matter."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Just doin' what I gotta do.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,Excuse me? This chicken is quite real to me.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,Nutrients?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,What's the last thing you ate?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Baloney and an orange.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo Rick,"Alright, Morty, a deal's a deal. Once we bring your Rick back to life, then I'll help you with the bully."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Sorry, Hologram Rick. I'm going with the crystal on this one."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Nope.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,COP,We've got an Akira-type situation going on behind the mall. Over.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Shield me from the law!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Wasp-Rick,"Damn, your Morty sucks."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Aah, wasps!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Why the hell didn't you show Morty how to bring my body back to life?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Shh, quiet, idiot. Quiet. It's gonna be alright. You don't get to know how you're gonna die."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,I-I thought you were proud to be a hologram!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"There's a lesson here, and I'm not the one that's gonna figure it out."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Oh, boy, so, you actually learned something today? What is this, ""Full House""? I was living in the moment all day, and it kept getting me kill by nazi. I Ithink you have to think ahead and live in the moment."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,"Oh, real nice, Rick.Turning our son into an Akira? Real nice."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Eat my ass, Jerry. He turned himself into Akira."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,"Oh, I'll eat it, because this is my house, Rick. I'll eat any ass I want."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Gross.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,I'm fine. Get off Rick's back. Rick wasn't even here when I was doing all that stuff. That was all on me.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,That finger has AIDs now. Not my fault.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,"He's messing with you, sweetie."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,But it's tingling!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,...cumfest and...
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Wait, wait, what the fuck?"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,Nothing. I didn't say anything. I was just playing along with you guys.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"You know I record everything, right? Garage, isolate Summer's voice and play back."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,"Oh, and then you guys can get married, and, like, suck each other off in a testosterone-addled fucking third-grade-boy cumfest and..."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Tickets Please Guy,"Tickets, please."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,Barkeep. A drink for my colleague.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"I know the only reason to travel by train is to travel with weapons. And we all know that at the end of this line, There's only one creature worth killing. The man in the white coat. May as well take turns exchanging stories. Mine begins on planet Ramamama."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"Lower him into acid. Once he's dissolved, lower someone else into acid. Is he dissolved? At least use the downtime to reset the acid lowerer. I really don't like the attitude around here. It's a very ""lower me into acid"" attitude."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,Who are you?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,How did you reach my sanctum?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"All right, this is going in circles. Seize him!"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,Very well. Now I will fight you.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"Anyway, he tells a different version of the story Where I start crying or something. That's why he has to die. 'Cause he's a liar. So... Why are you going to kill Rick Sanchez?"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"If you're trying to be hurtful, you're doing a good job."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Clam Alien,I'll take his turn. Here's why I'm going to kill Rick Sanchez.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Clam Alien,Dissolve to a clam-shaped sun Rising over a giant beach.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Candy Santa Alien,"By then, of course, he had left toys And flesh drops for every one of us in the spore-hive. Ah, a newcomer! I suppose you think you have a better story about how Rick Sanchez saved space Christmas."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Goomby,I think the best way to answer that is with my Christmas Rick tale.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Goomby,Tell your Christmas Rick story!
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,Uh-huh...
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Morty? I told you if you found me again, identify yourself."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,I didn't know it was you. How did you not recognize me? Didn't you create the disguises?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"When I create shit, it works, Morty. It's called being talented."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,Why can't we find the engine?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"It's not a real train, it's a story device. Literally. A literal literary device Quite literally metaphorically containing us."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,A simulation.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Worse. An anthology. Okay, so how... H-How do we hijack it?"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Oh, Morty, it's been hijacked for at least two full minutes. Are you not hearing this insane conversation? Okay, tickets please guy, stop the anthology. If we wanted one-offs, we'd do interdimensional cable, Not some uptight, overwritten... Rick? God damn!"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,"Dude, I'm sure you've got, like, So many tickets at this point. Jesus! The tickets please guy is cut! He... he... he's... he's got those things. W-What do you call them. Uhm, cum gutters."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Morty, gross!"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,That's what people call them.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Gross people. I don't want to have to picture cum so watery in such volumes that... Hey, hey, hey, stay back. I'll kick you. I-I'll kick your shin, bro. Aaah! Hey! I'll fucking cook and eat your ticket-taking ass!  Hey, I found a ticket.  Wow, you are just... Ladies and gentlemen, The Jackie chan of human shielding. Who takes the time to get this good at... Fuck this. Aaah... Structural breach. Losing continuity. Morty, hold on to something. Keep your head inside."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Female voice,Emergency continuity deployed.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,"He is Rick! Jesus Christ! Is that the tickets please guy? Well, just the stub. Too soon! Too soon! Don't move! Too soon! So, what did the train cops do wrong? Shot... People? Hot passengers. Wrong. The passengers tampered with the anthology's structure. Lethal response was permitted, But not with him holding that tank. Let's take a look at what they should have done. Train cops! Hands in the air! Drop the tank! Drop it! Drop it! Drop the tank.  Sorry to nitpick, sir, but if there was A continuity explosion, isn't there always one? And doesn't that mean those two could be anywhere? What? No, you idiot, that... it's... it's just a training video. That didn't actually happen. That's what you think. Hey. How'd you get here? Yeah, like we're the ones that popped up out of nowhere? Fuck these guys.  Hey, what the hell? Your leg is healed. Yeah, it's a real free-for-all. Here we go. Of course this thing is just a fucking circle. You'd think it was so God damn complicated... Okay, here's where the stupid vignettes were. God, imagine if that had been the whole thing. So now we're here, and the engine must be here. I'll have to rig us a couple of space suits that start failing around here so we can  pay a heavy price for re-entering at this threshold. We have to leave the train? We don't have to do anything, Morty. This is just a structural guide. We're obviously gonna impart our own style. I don't like how meta this is getting, Rick. Shut up, Morty. You're 14. You watch videos of people on YouTube Reacting to fucking YouTube. I'll be the judge of when we get too meta. Holy shit. How is he still breathing? Aah! He's suspended in disbelief, Slowly dying while living out an alternative Non-diagetic reality. Geez, what a horrible way to die. You don't know the half of it. Oh!  You're on fuego with the guy-torn-in-half bits, Rick. That one was organic, though. That's because you're naturally funny. That... that's good old-fashioned fun Right there, you know? W-w-we don't need to over-think shit, okay? Okay, buddy. Nice and grounded, Fully immersive from here on out.  Right after this. W-What's happening? Going into an act break.  ? Not quite a bird  ?  ? Not quite a person  ?  ? Maybe what matters  ?  ? Is to love yourself first and  ?  ? Soar  ?  ? Child of air and land  ?  ? With wings and hands  ?  ? Yes, you're a bird and a person  ?  ? I'm a bird and a person  ?  ? And more  ? Sure, that was a great moment, But it was hardly the best time Rick and Morty were musical. Who can forget the t... Hey. You guys think there's something weird about this train? We've been here a really long time And nobody's taken our tickets. Aaah!  Aaaah! The galaxy's greatest scientists continue to ponder The horrific figure known to children as floaty blood man. But after three months, nobody is any closer to the truth. For cutesy name news, I'm uncle nibbles. I can't believe floaty bloody man is real. He's more than real, he's my new God. Check it. Is that brand-new, Or is the blood just... Accurately depicted, yeah. His followers believe the entire universe is floaty bloody man's nightmare as he dies in a time-dilated reality. So we could go at any minute. No. I'm part of the floaty nogasm brotherhood. We believe we're keeping him alive By redirecting our suppressed sexual energies. You're staying a virgin Just to keep the universe existing? That's... So attractive. It is? Okay, look, let's just do it once.  Sorry. Aaah! Happy now? He was suffering. Keep moving. We have to get to the return threshold Before the ticking clock on your suit gets to zero. Why would you put ticking clock... Because if it's too easy to get there, We'll never get there. If you don't want to be meta stop, deconstructing shit. That's the thematic seal. Gotta find a way to disrupt it. Okay, Morty, tell a story unrelated to us."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,"Uh, what do..."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Okay, just stop."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Relax, your story was supposed to be awful and stupid. I just failed to predict how well that would mesh with the theme. Think. Think. What kind of story would we never... Morty, do you know what the bechdel test is?"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Story lord. I should've known you were behind this, and I did. Who is this guy? Ugh. He's like a matrix space frasier. Let's get this fight over with, nerd. I've got shit to do. You of all people know, Rick, There can be no destination without a journey. I don't know that at all. I regularly teleport. Oh, of course. No rules for you. Spiraling through the multiverse, Burping semi-improvised dialogue about how nothing matters, So we may as well pull out our dicks and rub them On fate's glaring teeth like we're brushing fate's teeth But we're using your gross, dirty dick. Must be nice.  Nobody's stopping you. True. Not anymore.  Goddamn! We already did this. Oh, is this a double beat? Oh, well. Just how I adventure, dawg. This is more impressive than the tickets please guy, though. You are like 90% cum gutter. It's called discipline. Watch this. God damn. Geez! Do we have to fight him? I don't want to. We surrender. We're not fighting.  Ow! Ow! Fucking kick your ass. Ow! Oh!  Hey! Get back in your egg! What the... Don't worry, Morty! Nothing out there is canon!  We've got a pulse. Stay with me, private. Smith, listen to me. You were exposed to a chemical that is altering your mind. To beat it, you have to hold on... We're losing him. Aliens. Sarge?! Morty, never forget the highest truth of all... You're getting your ass kicked on a train.  Professor Sanchez? Did it work? I wouldn't say that, Marcus. I'd say it fucking worked. 100% time dilation and total immersion. Define ""total."" Marcus, I've been back in reality for three hours, and I still have memories of a completely different life. I-I-I was a scientist still. I-I-I was... I-I-I had developed Inter-dimensional travel, I-I-I-I had a daughter. I-I didn't have a mustache. I-I was kinda funny sometimes, mostly burping. No more secret testing. I can help people now. You've helped people. I've hurt more. Aaah! P-p-professor Sanchez. I-I'm Morty Smith From the... the... The the 241st. They... they... put your pill in our food. It... it works. Call the police! It's okay. It's okay. It's not real. N-n-n-n-nothing's real. I'm sorry, son. I-I-it's okay. You aren't real.  God, you're right. I should do more freeform stuff. In you go. What's happening? The reason I brought you here. I'll now fuel my anthology with your limitless potential, propelling it to its final stop... beyond the fifth wall. You idiot. Our potential isn't limitless. You'll never break the fifth wall Before you've burnt us out. Is that so? Oh, well. Win-win. Rick, w-what's he doing? He's trying to tap into us, Morty. Resist. I can't believe you're finally headed off to college. Yeah, you know, it really felt like you were gonna be 17 forever. For, like, 16 years, at least. I can't believe I'm tearing up over this. Jesus, Rick, you know, you've really softened up. It's a human moment, Morty. It's a human moment. Aaah! Aaah! It hurts!  Abradolph lincoler? I thought you were dead. I'm very much alive, and I need your help. Yeah! Shit, he's taking the good stuff, Morty. Wait, is... is any of this canon? It could have been.  Oh, dear. Are there things Rick Sanchez holds sacred after all?    How did you find us?  I trusted you! Don't blame others for your bad decisions.  Resist, Morty! Resist before he burns us out! Oh, too late now! What's wrong, Rick? Don't you want to see how your story ends?!   ?  ?  Holy shit, Rick. What do we... There... there... There's now way out! You're right, Morty. Sometimes it does seem like there's no way out. Like it's hopeless. But remember, there's always someone there for us. Who? My best friend and personal savior, Jesus Christ. What?! You... you don't believe in God. But he believes in us, Morty. You know, I thought I was the inventor, but the greatest invention of all is the free gift of eternal life. Is this... Are you fucking with me?  Oh, trust me, Morty. I've done plenty of effed up stuff in my life. But it's never too late to accept Christ. Jesus is always knocking at the door. All we have to do is open it and let him into our hearts. How? I'm so glad you asked, Morty. Just close your eyes and go to him in prayer. Like this. Heavenly father. Heavenly father. Together"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Together,"Thank you for sending your only begotten son. What a second, no! What are you doing?! Jesus, I accept you into my heart. No! This sucks. Stop! You guys would never do this. Together: Fill me with your spirit. Make me a shining city on a hill for you. No! No! No, no, no. Make me born again. No! In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen! You did it! Way to go, Morty! Crossy. Bible-saurus. You made it. We wouldn't miss this for anything! You said it, Mr. Celery. What the fuck is all of this?! Greatest story ever told, story lord. No, it's not. It's awful!  I beg your pardon? Ah! Goddamn.  My lord and my God! No! No! It sucks in here. Let's get the fuck outta here. Go, now. Ugh. We're safe, Morty. Nobody ever wanted to see that shit. Wh-what's gonna happen to story lord? He gets to spend eternity in every writer's hell... The Bible. I don't know. Some people actually like that stuff. Seems kind of cynical. I just don't like taking cheap shots, you know? Cheap shots? Morty, we were literally Saved by Jesus Christ. Tell me in any way how that's offensive. This was a little confusing, But I guess it brought us closer together, you know? Tested our demons. Made us believe in ourselves more than ever. Yeah. You're right, Morty. We got all that meta-canon shit outta the way And now we can just be ourselves. Now what do you say we bring this train into the station.  ?  ? Oh, shit. Morty: So what do you think? Wow. Where did you get this thing? The citadel of Ricks gift shop. Do you really like it? I didn't think you'd even care. What? Morty. No. I love it. You did the most important thing. You... you bought something. What? You bought something. With money. God. I love money so much, Morty. Are you being sarcastic? Merchandise, Morty. Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise. And you did it. You went into a store... an actual honest to God store... And you bought something. You didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints. You... you just looked straight into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said ""yes, daddy, please."" And I'm... I'm so proud of you. I only wish you could've bought more. I... I love buying things so much, Morty. Rick, are... are you... Do you need to go to the hospital? I love you, Morty. Give grandpa a kiss. Give... give... gimme... Give grandpa a kiss. Lips if you want. What... whatever you're comfortable with. Some cultures do that. That was sweet. Thank you. I... I love you. You're my little buddy. Okay. Let's watch some interdimensional cable.   So you're saying my father And his kingdom... Well, yes... it's based on the fusion of a sumerian God named ""ya"" And a mesopotamian God named ""way."" And we're in a toy train? Yes. It's enough to really make you question All of existence, isn't it? So what do you think you're gonna do about it? I'm gonna do what I've always done. I'm gonna get the fuck outta here. Father of omens! Give me blood beyond sight!  Hey, what the fuck, Morty? The train you got me just completely derailed itself. There's blood all over the windows on it. Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick. I guess I'll return it. Return... Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty. Consume, Morty. Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus. Where's your fucking wallet?!  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,Tired of the same boring adventures With your dogshit Morty?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Deep voice,Story train. Story train.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"The citadel of Rick's story train Comes with car after car of enemies, lovers, and goomby, all grappling with the nature of who you truly are. Rick is a God!

Rick: And of course, what story would be complete without the engineer of the greatest story ever told. Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus: I have come not to judge The world, but to save it. Rick: And the best part is, the fun never ends. Thanks to the Rick-patented anthology generator, You'll never run out of new stories And people to tell them. Are they alive? Of course.

4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,My name is Beth Smith. Tell your top bugs the Defiance lives on.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Beth Smith.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You could connect it to not dying.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Damn it. We risked our lives for that? You did your best.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,I don't have to miss it. I'm technically still there. My dad made a perfect clone of me to take my place.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Who cares? Are we done?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Dr. Wong had a cancellation today. Anybody up for a family session?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,I could do that. I'm... I'm down to clown.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet will be done in time."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Great, because she specifically asked you to stop bringing puppets. Dad?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"I love therapy, family therapy most of all, but I am actually disintegrating. Whoa! Oh, my God! Dad!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Is that really it? We did it? It's the invisibility belt. Whoa-whoa-whoa!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"He grazed them. That's gonna hurt in like 10 seconds. Thanks, Morty. Why should I let you use it? You never let me use it. Can I have the belt? It would really piss off Morty. Fantastic idea."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"What the hell?! You jerk! Give it! Hey! Ow! Share the invisibility. Jerry? Ooh, this looks like a job for Mr. Nibbles. Let me just glue one more eye on. I'm gonna kill you!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Woof. Looks like you two have to fight about why you can't control your kids. Good thing Dr. Wong's got an opening. Bye.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You're a bad father.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Don't let him divide us.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Garage, family therapy mode. Ah. Honey, you're back."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You seem surprised.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You never wrote.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,And never exploded?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,What I'm hearing is that you think that's a bomb.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,So does every engineer that's seen it.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Engineer? Princess, I'm sure every caveman that sees a microwave calls it a rock cabinet. The point of inventing is to make things that don't exist."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Then whip me up a reason not to kill you.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Dad? We're off to Dr. Wong's.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Scan her.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Dad?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth as Rick,"Okay, have fun, pumpkin. Sorry I'm a piece-of-shit father."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Oh, ha-ha! Well, the self-loathing buys a lot back."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Jerry, leave the puppet."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"It's a one-way ticket to a breakthrough, Beth."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,The device in her neck would have transferred a database of her memories to your device before vaporizing her. So much for that plan.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Why is she... it... why am I back with Jerry? I thought she was a copy of me.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"She is a copy of you. If she ran back to that dingleberry, that's on you. Want to grab a drink?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,All the time.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Good girl.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,To catch a predator.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,What the hell?!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Thermal goggles, bitch. Mom said share."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,You can't share invisibility. Take those off.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,No.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,So I'll just see you at cheerleader practice? Should I bring a poncho?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,All right! State your terms.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,Give back the belt. You take the goggles. Go away. We trade in an hour.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,Deal.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"How do you like that, bitch?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,Iliked it more than my old belt. "Tiny Big Man Junior"? You shoulda shared.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Random guy,What are you doing in my house?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,Did I wander that far from my console? They should put a warning on these things.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"So, we overrode the gates, and the slave rebellion took the capital. Pretty cool."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Very cool. My daughter, having space adventures. They are skewing a tad ""Star Wars""-y, though. Don't forget to have fun."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Well, I came back to murder you, not get your notes, but I'll remember to fart more while I'm saving the galaxy."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Okay, I'm the one that made this possible. It's not a competition. Of course not."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Just curious, though, if it were, would ""most wanted"" be first place?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You're fighting the Gromflomites?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Dad, they're trying to take over the galaxy!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Everybody in the galaxy tries to take over the galaxy. The trick is to be left alone by whoever succeeds. Eh, it's your hero phase. I had one, too. You'll outgrow it."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"No, you did. I'm not gonna outgrow giving a shit."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Oh, come on."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Way to give a shit. Next time, don't wipe it on your home planet. Oh, shit. They're gonna track down Beth."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You mean... Beth's clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Right. Beth's clone. What... What did I say? It really was nice seeing you again.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You're a monster!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,Still wanna share?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Uh, yes."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Uh, I can."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr. Wong,"Jerry, do you agree that the use of puppets makes you seem dumb and crazy?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,I don't think "crazy" is a responsible word to use in...
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,It is now. This is crazy. You're being crazy.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"They do it in therapy on TV. Well,"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,"TV gives British people prizes for baking, Jerry."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Tonya?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Tammy?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Tammya? Tammya.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I like your hair better this way. How's the stomach?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,What?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Hey! I only said "hey." It's not like I can do more than that.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"As much as I'd like to kill you, my superiors have some questions about the Defiance."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I don't have a...
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"I have a Defiance? Oh, God, I'm a clone."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,That's your defense?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"No, my defense is eat me."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Hey! Ah! We've been over this. All I do is say "hey."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Smart guns, white-list human life. And the therapist.  Tammy, this is the office where my family works to better itself."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"What, and that makes it sacred?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"No, it makes it a place I've rigged with a lot of voice-activated escape contingencies.  These are all good points. I need to take a long look at myself."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,I'd like to discuss that.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"I don't discuss problems, I incinerate them. Everybody in the car. Everybody in my family, not the world. Jesus, Wong. Boundaries."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,I'm better than this job.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Your children are down there invisible, Jerry. ""Make a portal""? Father of the year back here."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Well, you're one to talk. You told me I wasn't a clone."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Y-You're not a clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"And who is that? Uh, uh, a clone."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Why would you make a clone of me just to send the clone into space?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Well, you didn't want to go, and I thought, ""Okay, that's cool."" But then I thought, ""Well, you know what would be even cooler is a space daughter,"" s-so I made one. And I put a bomb in her neck in case she ever came back."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Father of the year.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,She wasn't supposed to come back.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Why did she?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Well, she found a bomb in her neck. Wouldn't you?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Father of the year.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Shut up!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I'm tired of believing you. I want to talk to her.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"No, you don't. Jerry, do something."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Hey.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,He told me you're the clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,What do you think he told me?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You're the clone?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Wow, naive and attractive."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Wow, jaded and hot."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"I know this is bad parenting, but if you stop fighting, you both get McDonald's."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"How about I just blow my brains out, starting with hers?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Okay, Wendy's. We love Wendy's. I-I think they even gave us some money."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Drop it. Don't move!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"Everybody, shut up! You're all saying different shit. Wait, so there are two of them?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"More importantly, which one is mine?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Uh, neither, chauvinist."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Whatever. Take them both.  ?  ?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Cool beam. But let's bargain. I'm the one you really want.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Excuse me?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Uh, smartest man in the universe? Secret to interdimensional travel? Ask your bosses."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"My bosses are bugs, Rick. You killed the old ones. The new ones are half my age. They know if you're left alone, you're a non-threat."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Oofa!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,We got the payload. Fire up the NX-5. Earth's going Ta-ta. You might want to do that thing where you find a new universe where you can suck yourself off.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You can't tell me what to do.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Awesome. He resisted. We can shoot him.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Wha?i
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rck,"Just go with it, Jerry. Everybody, drop your guns... except for Jerry! Fucking classic.  Holy shit. Morty."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,And Summer.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,W-We worked together. That's... that's our arc.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,We went from siblings to invisible to working together.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"It's not ""Citizen Kane,"" but why compete with whatever's going on here, you know?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You made me go to a wedding. And you killed my best friend. I shoulda said that one first.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Ugh, guess the galaxy's most-wanted mammal needs her daddy to come change her diapie. Come on, kids, we have to go do a fucking piece of shit ""Star Wars."""
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Oh, am I not a non-threat now?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Summer, try unlocking that door by scanning your high-school friend's dead face."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Uh, I have... I have to pee."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Pee on the floor. It's a Death Star.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Okay, but there's rebellion and then there's..."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Here, Dad."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Perfect.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,What am I doing wrong?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Ugh, her eyes are closed. Morty, open the left one. I've got the right. She died the way she lived, overserialized. I'm gonna rescue your mom and her clone without revealing which is which. You two find the NX-5 and shut it down. I mean, don't die trying. There's infinite Earths. If you can save this one, it's gravy."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,Dream team rides again!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Oh, yeah, we're like Luke and Leia. Uh, except no kissing part. What's another famous brother-sister team?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Uh, Hansel and Gretel?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Yeah, right, those two were fucking. Dad, we need the belt."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,I can't go with you guys watching.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You're invisible.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,What if the pee isn't?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You know what? We don't need invisibility. Working together is our belt.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,That's our arc. Let's do it. I'm gonna go ahead and whistle. That's how good I feel.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Oh, God. I knew it. Ugh, this floor isn't level."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Are they gonna torture us?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Unless you plan on telling them what I know. Last chance to guess who was the clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"You're his daughter. Just something about the eyes, the shameless abandonment of your family. However can I live with myself?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"One theory... I was designed by your father to live with myself, which would mean you made a conscious choice to swallow your dreams with cheap wine and dinosaur pasta."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"You know that's the kind Jerry likes, same way I know the only goddamn dream you'll ever follow is your shitty father's approval."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You fetch your shitty father's lemonade.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You cosplay as your shitty father in his 30s.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"More like dead alert. What else? What else? I wrote some stuff down in my Notes app. Let me just find it. Screw it. Beth, if... if one of you is still alive, you're my real daughter. If you're both alive, don't hurt the other one. She's just a clone. She's not worth it. I'm coming, baby."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,That piece of shit.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Bath,That piece of shit.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"I came back kill him, you know."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I'd like to help.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,It is now Phoenix Person.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"You're working for them? What did they do to you, BP?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,It is now PP. Where is Tammy?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Oh, don't worry about her. I killed her."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,I loved her.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Really? Huh. Then can I suggest, as an alternate name, Crazy Pussy Whipped Person?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,It's funny. I always wondered who would win if we ever fought.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,Then you were always a bad friend.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Morty, we had one grenade. He had a gun. Whatever. Come on."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You gave it away!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,You said we didn't need it. I wish you were never born.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You were an accident.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"You kill a good bug, for a horse doctor."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Thanks, me. Maybe we could do, like, a ""Parent Trap"" thing together sometime."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,As long as you mean the Lindsay Lohan version.  Naturally.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Hey, over here. Look at me."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"I used to be invisible, but now I'm the opposite."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,I killed them! I-I did... I did it offscreen.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"God damn it. Morty, fix your underwear. I saw your balls for a second."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,That's on you.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Never thought this was how I'd die.  We're nowhere near Venice, and you're not a dwarf in a raincoat."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Step back. You're not killing him till we kick his ass, Bird Person."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,"""Tammy""","Bird Person, stop. It's me, that Tammy girl."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,"Tammy, this is unexpected. I was told you were dead. That is ab-so-lute-ly not true. I'm more alive than I've ever been."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Saved the day with puppeting. Only one with a decent arc. He does have his moments.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Mom, Dad! Mom. Uh, we did it! Morty became super visible!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,Summer put my jeans in a laser!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Morty, look at your little balls! I know! Bring it in here, guys. Damn, this thing has twin turbines?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,I'll forgive you for abandoning us if you let me drive it. That works for me...
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"I was just gonna give you space cigarettes. I love having two moms. And I love having two wives. Never gonna happen, Jerry."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You jerk-offs ready to get the answers to your burning questions?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"What's this, Dad?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"The memory of which Beth is real and which Beth is a clone, obviously."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You mind-blew yourself?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You... You literally don't even know which of your daughters is real. Of course you don't. Why am I surprised?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"I'm sure you'd love for us to need that from you, but I don't care what's in that vial."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Yeah, me neither. You're a piece of shit either way."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"So what? After all this, you don't want to know the truth? The truth is we have more important shit to do like raise our kids and stamp out the Federation, neither of which seem like they want anything to do with you."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Morty? Sum-Sum? You gotta at least wanna know who your real mom is. Not really, Rick. We have two badass moms now. It's... That's kind of a win/win."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Yeah, Grandpa Rick, don't drag us into your bullshit just because you're losing control. k"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I know what I want to do. I want you to decide.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,What?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"For once in my life, I want you to decide, Dad. Do you want me to stay here and be part of your life, or do you want me to leave?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh shit, I almost parked but Morty hold on wat-watch this."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Uh-huh.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Well I thought it was cool. So should be in and out, simple exchange, not even an adventure. And if anything goes wrong which it won't, jump into the same vat of acid I jump into."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Okay. W-wait what? Wha-what vat of acid?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"What, Morty! Close the door."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"I pre-scouted this location and placed a vat of fake acid amongst the real ones. It's got air horses and a compartment of bones at the bottom. If things go wrong, which they won't, we jump onto the vat of acid and I'll release the bones, they'll float up-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,What is this face you're making?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Aren't you an inventor?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Yeah, what part of a fake acid vat with built-in air supply and quick release bones isn't inventive enough for you and when did my job become pitching you ideas?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Alright! Let's just do this. I have English homework.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You're still learning English? That's the language you speak. How dumb are you?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Intresting choice of meeting place, Rick."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You like it? My grandson had notes.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Come on.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Show him the crystals, Morty."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,I'll make lots of money with these.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I'll make lots of those with these.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Well, those are fake."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Come on."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You gotta be kidding me. Seriously?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You brought fake crystals and a gun?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,Beats real crystals and no gun.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Okay, but does anything beat fake crystals and a fake arm?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Whoa, do you know who I am?! Even if you kill me, you're a dead man."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Are you serious? Morty, he's right we're screwed. Let's just end it, quik death come on."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Aw, man. Oh!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Ohhhhh!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,The Dealer Group,"Woah, Hey, Oh My God!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,Holy Shit! What the Fuck?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Moustached Goon,Holy Shit.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,What kind of psycho? His own grandson?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Moustached Goon,Guess he took your threat pretty serious.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Yeah, but it just doesn't make any sense."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"Well, he was a scientist. Maybe he knew more about acid, maybe it's like the most painless way to go."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"How could that have been painless? You saw that pause before the bones floated up. That has to be like five seconds of unparalleled torture. I can't get my head around it. I, I thought I'd seen this galaxy at it's darkest. This is going to take a while to feel normal."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,"We're pretty good listeners boss, drinks are on us if you want to talk it out."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Thanks, but what happened, it happened here. I don't wanna lose the moment."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"Take your time, boss. We'll stay as long as you want."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,"Absolutely, I got nowhere to be."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"And then, little Tommy Flim-flam's running down the Hyperloop. His ass is on fire from Xenon fluid, but his AI hologram is fucking his own Pee hole."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,Great story boss.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Really detailed
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Yeah, well I got a million of 'em. All right, I think I'm ready to deal with the world now. Let's geet out of here."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Should we drop our buddy in here before we go?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Yeah, probably a good idea."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Should we use a different vat? Does acid lose its acid power the more it dissolves?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"What am I, an Acidologist? Here grab that rat-like creature. We'll do a little test."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Look, if you the damn acid, don't use a rat. Take that ladle, grab a spoonful and put it in the analyzer."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"I'd say that's pretty acidy, drop him in."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,What are you doing?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,You said-
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Not the rat, the guy."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Ohhh!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,Look at the size of the bones on that rat.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,"Oh, how many sets of bones this rat got?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"Look how the smaller ones are shaped, their like little cartoon bones. Like if you dreaw a bone in art class."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Alright that tears it, I'm cancelling of the rest of my night and calling a bone scientist. We're getting to the bottom of this-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Jesus Fucking Chist enough already!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,The fuck is wrong with you?!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Just admit is was a shitty idea!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Having a grandson?!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"A vat of fake acid, are you dying of dementia?!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,How are you talking to me like this? Wh-whe-When did you get so cocky?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Tonight! Tonight Rick. The night I saw you fail.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Because you ruined it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,It was pre-ruined!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh was it worse than when I was a pickle? Oh-oh-oh, that's right, you weren't there for that, turns out kind of cool. Maybe there's a connection there"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Excuse me?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,What's that cool thing you did without me again? The awesome thing? I-I-I guess you wanted a dragon ?*Does a chef's kiss Unforgettable.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,God fuck you
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Timely too, you really got in that ""Game of Thrones"" fever right at the peak"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You trying as hard as you can to hurt me right now proves my point.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I'll let you know when you have a point and the world will know whe I try to hurt you.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Big man, big genius, big lonely drunk."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Hey save some of these atomic-age beatnik zingers for your English homework, Bukowski."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,RIck,"There's no such thing as a bad idea, Morty. It's about execution."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"No such thing as a bad idea except all of mine, right?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Morty, wanting a dragon isn't an idea."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"I'm not talking about that! I'm constantly pitching you ideas, Rick, and you act like they're not even worth thinking about."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"What, the helicopter lawn chair? That's just something you saw on TV."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,What about my video-game-style place-saving device?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh my God, here we go."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"It's a good idea, Rick! A device that lets you-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Save your place like in a video game but in real life so that you can try stuff and then go back to your save point, yes Morty, I saw it on ""Futurama."""
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Oh, so you don't do anything unless it's original?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I don't do time travel.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"It's not time travel, it's saving a place in time-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh my God, is this what you think I do? This is where the heavylifting happens in your mind? Do you have any idea how much fucking work would have to go into a machine that-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Ah-ha! You can't do it.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"I can do anything, Morty. Your idea is not worth doing."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You can't do it.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Before what you're trying to do was called ""negging,"" it was called ""reverse psychology"" and incels didn't incent it, Bugs Bunny did."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You can't do it.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,There is nothing I cannot do.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,A place-saving video-game thing!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You're a piece of shit!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Just say you can't do it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I won't
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You won't say you can't?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Fuck you, Morty!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Fuck you!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Fuck you!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,So are you gonna-
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Yes, I'm gonna fucking do it!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Rick, it's 3 am..."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"You were right Morty sighs I failed, I can't make it. And honestly I'm pretty ashamed, that might be what I've been so aggressive and unfair about rejecting your ideas."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Rick..
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"A vat of fake acid, Morty? Maybe I've lost it"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,H-Hey cmon you know I didn't mean it that way. I just think we need to find better ways to communicate
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"I'm sorry I just... lash out sometimes. I-I-I don't know what I do that, I am so ashamed of myself. Hearing you talk about the vat, it really opened my eyes. Like what the fuck am I even doing"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Hey-Hey I don't like hearing this talk, you're a great inventor, we just got a couple of things to work on, let's start with inventing a little honesty, sound good?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Thank you Morty, sounds good. Or maybe I'll just kill you"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,What? Whoa Whao Whao Whao Rick
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Because I fucking did it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You did it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I did it you son of a bitch!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,How did you?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Morty do you want me to explain, or do you wanna go have fun"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,I wanna go have some fun! Rick this is this is thank you
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"You can thank me later, go nuts."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Best grandpa ever!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,that's all I ever wanted to hear
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Space Beth,"Jerry, I had sex with your wife."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I did it. I fixed portal travel.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jack,Jack the Ripper at your service.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Cool
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,This happened too?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Summer,I'm pregnant.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jerry,"Honey, she's just like you."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,It's raining meatballs.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Okay, something is-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Priest,Jerry Smith died doing something he loved. Getting stung by bees.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Off what?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Have some respect. It's dad's funeral.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Summer,I'm gonna name you Jerry Jr.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Tony,Thanks for solving that murder guys! Here's a skateboard.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Aw thanks Tony Hawk.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Morty, say you'll marry me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Just say yes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Yes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Okay?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Rick, do you promise-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"I do, and for our honeymoon, let's go to a, sealed chamber lined with ionized deuterium."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Why?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Cause the charge acts as a narrative decelerate. Morty, none of this is real. We're in a ""previously on"" spiral. Clear your head."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,After all that's happened?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,No.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Beth,I'm innocent! I didn't release the bees! I love Jerry!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,What did I just say?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,When?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Okay, great execution. Let's go back to the chamber."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Now repeat after me Morty. Next time on Rick and Morty.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Next time on Rick and Morty.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,"No, previously on Rick and Morty."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Ignore it Morty. Next time on Rick and Morty. It counteracts his toxins.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Next time on Rick and Morty. Who's toxins?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Hey stop it!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Previous Leon! Grab him!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Hang on tight Morty! We gotta get through the opening titles!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Opening titles of what?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,And we're back
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What just happened? Why was there music?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Cause of this conceptual little piece of shit. Grab his feet.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"If we have opening titles, does that mean we're in a-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Let your body purge the meta-venom Morty. Don't succumb to his pointless self-aware bullshit.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,"It's not pointless, it's cool."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He's got a gun!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Eat lead pussy!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, no, no. Fuck!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Son of a-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He can use a portal?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"He wishes. He wriggled back into the meta-layer through the hole in the fourth wall.  Put these on, and help me find it."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I don't like this Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, you shouldn't. It's not a likable premise. It's funny when I do a little nod to the viewers but-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What viewers?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"That's the right attitude Morty. A few carefree verbal asides, always by me. None of this season 3 moonlighting shit. Okay, here it is."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Your going to patch it?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, he subverted actual reality Morty.  He needs to be put down like a rabid dog."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Ow fuck!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Oh yeah. You don't wanna wear those over here.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Maybe he went down that road
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, no, no. If he took that, he'd end up a hero."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Dammit Rick. I don't like this. Is this whole place just-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,A bunch of groan-inducing wordplay for seven TV critics that won't even enjoy it? This is worse than you think Morty. We're basting in meta radiation right now. Our credibility is being permanently eroded. Every second we're in here is equivalent to 10 Space Jam cameos.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,You should've thought of that previously.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Get him!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Oh no!  Bless me heavenly father. For you will save me
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Now I feel bad. Let's just get out of here.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Because he prays? You know Hitler was Catholic right?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,I'm here Leon.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Okay he apparently prays very well.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Time for you two to meet the Lord.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"It's okay, we're good. Treat it like a bear attack Morty. Walk backwards and make yourself look big."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I love a good refusal to call. Hello Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Hello, Amish Juggler?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,His name is Story Lord.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Story Lord? Listen, trust me. Take Amish Juggler, you can have it."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Story Lord! Rick, he's the villain from the toy train I bought you."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Very good Morty. The fictional versions of you trapped me in a Bible show for children, but I used make-believe Christ to transcend fiction and enter meta-reality. Now, I'm the one doing the trapping. Leon was the bait."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Bait?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Jesus?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You're using Jesus to beat us up? Have you seen South Park?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Good call-out Morty. That's the kind of meta I like. The kind that keeps us creatively accountable.  Oh, not the Bane, not the Bane.  He Baned me Morty. Jesus Baned me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You can't beat me up. I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm technically a Christian child.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,And I'm your worst nightmare. I'm the Jesus from every Jesus joke. The one without a god.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Morty, take this and go."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Thank you! Looks like Story Lord's story is about to become based on real events.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,What do you want from that?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I want what any character wants. Motivation.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,What?  That's dumb.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,That's lazy.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Wait what? He just left.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Kinda wanna make you our unlikely ally huh?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Previously on Jesus Christ.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,"Hey, I'm Jesus."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mary,I'm Mary
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,That's my mom's name
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mary,Stop!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Disciple,She's a hooker.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,She's a better disciple than you!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Oh no! I can't die.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Soldier,I have a proposition for you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,I work alone.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Dracula,"If I suck your blood, I'll be invincible I think."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,You'll never know
6,Full Meta Jackrick,News reporter,Billionaire immortal entrepreneur Jesus Christ has placed all his money into what he's calling a second chance at love.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Hang on Mary!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mary,The data! So beautiful
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,"Make me normal, witch."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,"Take this, haaah!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Nurse,Eat your pudding Mr. Christ. What are you smiling at?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,your name.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What's happening Rick?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Leon's venom makes you think more and more of your life is behind you as he feeds on your released potential.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Leon, you saved our lives."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Oh, not yet he hasn't."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Jeez Rick, so mean?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,He's meta Morty. His life doesn't matter. Yours does. That's why we need to get back.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Well this doesn't look like the citadel.  Maybe it's cooler on the inside.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,This isn't what it looks like. This is a very special diet for very successful writers. Why do you look like my character?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"I am your character, and you are going to improve me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,But you're Story Lord. You're great.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Great isn't good enough. I killed Rick and made myself real. I'm better than some shitty toy train. Is this your office or your apartment? Why does it smell like you sleep here? You are my creator. Why are you pathetic?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,Because you failed.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,And who's fault is that? What the hell happened?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"You wanna know happened? Like specifically? Well the Ricks wanted to do a Canterbury-tales type of thing, but none of them fucking read Canterbury-tales, so then they told me to make it like a poker game episode of the Batman cartoon, where the bad guys tell stories about Batman. Then they tell me it needed something. Yeah, no shit it needed something. I needed to ever be pitched. I did my job. Goomby, the Ice Queen, the Tickets Please Guy. They just bailed on it. The website didn't even fucking work. There was a shitty URL to begin with. Story-dash-train? Who uses a dash? They set me up to fail. They fucked me. They fucked me, and you're lucky I didn't blow their brains out."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Right, just give me motivation you hacky fart."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Okay, here's your motivation. Looking for motivation. You want all the motivation."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,That's lazy.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,It got you this far. Must be nice by the way. Wish I could afford to dress like a bisexual acting coach from the 70s.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,My motivation is motivation.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Okay, bye."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Oh no, my bitter friend.  You're coming with me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yo, if you don't see me coming, it's a bad fortress!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Where are we?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Headquarters of the Self-Referential Six. They're meta nerds that found out they could be less bearable as a team.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,They can help us?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, but there's a prisoner in here who can. Shh! Don't tell them that!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Miss Lead,Rick Sanchez! I've been waiting for this moment for years.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Oh good. Morty, this is Miss-  Lead."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Miss Lead,I should kill you where you stand.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I brought you Previous Leon. You'll want to lock him up in your detention center.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,It's a trick. He wants you prisoner.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You dick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Miss Lead,Liar!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Talk about a mislead. Anti-meta field.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Flash Back,Fancy device. I think I can recall the time you built it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Don't try it Flash Back!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You know I'm excited about the upcoming election.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,This force field will be impenetrable by meta-energy. It runs on hydrogen isotopes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Flash Back,Hmm.  Hydrogen isotopes!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Connie Tinuity Error,A few barrels of petroleum should dampen it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Run Morty!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Connie Tinuity Error,Were those not there before? Guess there has been a Connie Tinuity Error.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,These people are the worst!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I told you. Way overpowered.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Look out Rick!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Forget him. He's a nameless guard.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,That's Protago Nick! His beam has the power to make any character the protagonist.  Duck!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Marvin,Oh man! Oh man! Oh man! Ah! What are you doing Marvin? Not dying. That's what I'm doing.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Katie,"Oh, what's going on? What happened?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Marvin,I did it again Katie. I ran out on another job.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Katie,"Well if you didn't do that, you wouldn't be my man."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I was almost tempted to let it go. That's how much I hate it here.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Smash cut!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Remember me Rick?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Who's this guy now?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,I am Mr. Twist.  The fifth member of the Self-Referential Six.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Who's the sixth?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,That's the twist Morty. It's you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Ignore him Morty. The twist is that there's no sixth member, and he tells that to everybody."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,"In any case, you're ours now. You can't free yourself without a twist, and I control them."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"You don't control every Twist, Mr. Twist. I got a twist for you."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Impossible. What is it?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Nice try. Like I didn't see that coming.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Fuck me!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Great work Morty!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I'm adapting!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Here's are ticket out of here. We got him in a cell made out of spores, because it's the opposite of story."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Do I wanna ask who he is?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,His name is Brett Caan. He has power is to make things always have been other things.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I think that's called retconning. His name is Brett Caan? Rhett can also be a name. His name can be Rhett Caan?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,"Oh it is, and it always have been, now."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Woah!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Careful Morty. Stay clear of his retcon range. Until he agrees to help us.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,Help you. You've always trusted me.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Nice try. Here's how it's gonna work. You're gonna make it so that Morty and I never came here. Once that's always been the case, I'll free you remotely with this."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Machine,What is my purpose?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,To wait until I tell you to pull the lever.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Machine,You are fucking kidding me.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,"If you don't free me right now Rick, I can make very very bad things always have been the case."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Is that a threat you fuck. Y-y-you can rot in there.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Rick?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You know what Brett. Forget what I said. We have always been friends.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,Good one.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Connie Tinuity Error,Woah! Easy Brett. Don't forget that coffee mug I gave you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,You were always been able to be killed by coffee.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,New plan Morty. Run. Again.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,The twist being-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,You were born without bones.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,There has been nothing outside this fortress.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,God dammit!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,The fortress has always been an orange!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Great plan Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, I'm not pushing back on that Morty. I have really fucked us."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Ugh, it hurts."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,We've been past the fourth wall too long Morty. We won't be real for much longer.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You've killed us Rick. You just had to hate meta storytelling.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"In my defense Morty, I think you have to agree, my hate was justified."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Least earned death ever.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Death is a threshold.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Huh.. what- what happened?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,You were cold.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Who- who are you?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"I'm Joseph Campbell.  Soup? I almost considered not making it, because my name is Campbell, but then I thought, stay in the moment Joe. Follow your bliss."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,How are you here? Brett Caan said there was nothing.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Some things never change about mythology. There's always an old man with soup. Name one story that doesn't have one.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Uhh Jack in the Beanstalk.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Basketball Diaries.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Every Matrix.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Every movie ever.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"Alright, I don't have to defend myself here."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Where's my soup?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Previous fucking Leon. Why is that prick here?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,He's no more a prick than you friend.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Meta characters erode reality.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"But all characters are meta Rick. All of us are nourished and consumed by chaos, like newborns at the breast of a meth addict in a lifeboat filled with forks."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I know what you have to do Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Scrub Campbell's browser history?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Just trust Previous Leon. Can you previously us a way home?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,I sure enjoy trying.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, I bet you would."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"Rick can't change Morty. Change is what you might call his Kryptonite, except instead of being super, he's you know. Kind of a pussy."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Let's do it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Previously on Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Get him off! Get him off!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He almost killed you!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Well I feel bad. I kinda pressured you into trying-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You calling me a pussy?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,I said I feel bad.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,This is a map to a region rich narrative ore. I wish you the best of luck.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Faster Morty! I'd help but I can't blister my inventing hands.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,How long will it take?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Years.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,You can live in my wood shed. Just don't open the door after dark.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Why not?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Person at the door,Come out you communist Jews!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Dude, maybe I'm not an alcoholic."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I know right.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Person at the door,You fucking Back to the Future ripoffs!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,It's ready.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Rick, I should stay."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Why?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I'm pregnant.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What are you doing? It wasn't him Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Well then who?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Me! I never left! But you had to think all this had happened to make that.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,So I can take this through the titles.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,If you hang on tight.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What about my beard and unborn child?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Let them go.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Thank you Leon.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"When you get home Rick, do some classic adventures. Like season 1-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I'm so sick of that fucking note. What the fuck does it even mean?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Now one last time, what's my motivation?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,Motivation. This machine will siphon it from everyone in the universe.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Perfect! Green lit! Launch it!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Yes, it's working! I can feel it! Something I'm doing is actually affecting someone!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #1,I don't wanna work anymore.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #2,"I do, but there's no excuse to not practice guitar."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Putter,Why don't we write any number down on the score sheet?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Person watching Putter,Why even do that?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #3,Wait you have to register?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Yes! I can feel it! I'm so motivated! I want a lot!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Story time's over.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Hardly your decision.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Did you seriously double down on motivation as your motivation?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,It's a good idea!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"There's no such thing. There's joyful and there's joyless, and we've had our fill of one."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Morty, make that sweaty writer stop working, while I kill off this character."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I have never been more driven to destroy someone!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, well I'm driven to lower my blood sugar, but guess who's getting tacos after he kicks your ass?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,So you're jacked. Who cares?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Cum gutters.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I don't like that phrase.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I don't take notes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,You can't beat me Rick.  I have one million times your motivation.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,So do those guys with the cell phone kiosks at the mall.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,The hair is wrong.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Like you'd be picky about licensing.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Actually I do. I happen believe that-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You can do that?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,You gotta want it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Come on. Just stop. I-I don't wanna fight you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Kid, I'm a writer that ruined something successful. So if you want me to give it up, you're gonna need a black belt or a great pair of tits."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Yeah well I don't have those.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"In the mythical sense, I am both."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Joseph Campbell?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,Nice try. He died in the 80s.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Only you can see and hear me Morty. Just repeat after what I tell you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Okay.  Sir, you're only proud of your creation's success, because you want to be creative, but creation doesn't happen through gimmicks, technology, and distribution. It doesn't even happen through work. Creativity is frankly adjacent to mental illness, and overlapped with it substantially. A lot of talented people kill themselves, and all of them are miserable. The real gift is to be ungifted, and from what I saw in your Green Arrow script, that's the gift you were given."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,You couldn't have seen that.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I'm Joseph Campbell. I saw it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,The villain was a placeholder.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"I said I saw it Jan. I didn't say I could get past page five. Your villains aren't the problem. The problem is when you write, you're a villain. If you wanna be a hero, just stop."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #3,You know what? Maybe I will register.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Tell me I'm the new Mr. Nimbus.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Oh. Looks like your writer took a hiatus.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Ah fuck.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"You're less motivated to fight now, so this is literally punching down, but you saw it coming."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,You failed me.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,No. I failed you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,All good things must come to an end.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"All bad things do though, so don't flatter yourself."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Joseph Campbell says you're the one that has to put him down.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Wait, wait, wait, Joseph Campbell also says you have to use this brand new limited edition Rick plush  available only on rick-plush.biz. Supplies are limited. Act now."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He did?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Jesus, that's the last time I buy a toy from a Rick."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,The plushies are obviously well made.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Thanks for getting us back alive Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Well I am a master at both worlds Morty.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Joseph Campbell told me to stop writing, because it should be effortless, and when it happens organically, that's what it's meant to be. You know like umm like me. I'm a writer, here's a pencil. Writers use pencils. Okay so like, what if the pencil used me? Like okay yeah, so it's like a magic pencil that writes the writer's life. Holy shit it's a movie about a writer. I'm back!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Tag Man,"Yeah, I'm Tag Man. I-I-I live in the tag. I-I-I am the tag. I'm Tag Man. Tag-tag of the episode man.  Did you get any of that?  Yeah, when the episode's over, look out because  Yeah, here comes Tag Man, and I go crazy. Tag Man yeah.  I'Imma tag your ass. Tag that ass.  Tag Ass Man. I'm that Ass Man now.  I'm Tag Man. Here's what you get. Here's your tag. You want some more? You want some more tag, you sick pieces of shit? Cause I'm Tag Man.  I miss my wife. Too bad. This is it. Tag Man yeah."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Ugh, guess this is how it ends. I thought I was better than this. Dramatic voiceover while stranded in space? I-I guess when you're dying, the first thing to go is your creativity. Citadel's gone, and-and the saucer we escaped in is out of power."
6,Solaricks,Alternate Morty,"Oh man, I'm so scared in here ?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,The extra Mortys went feral?
6,Solaricks,Alternate Morty,Gahhhh!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"?Eh, some problems solve themselves. Been drinking a lot?Morty! I told you to write this down! I-I don't have a helmet like that Avengers guy did!?been drinking a lot of my piss. Portal Gun's still broken."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Guess that was all part of Evil Morty's plan.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"""Evil Morty"". Can we stop flattering this guy? His plan was to monologue and fuck off! He basically threw a tantrum to announce he was quitting twitter!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Nobody quits Twitter.  Hey, remember, like a second ago, when you pretended to not know who Iron Man was. Who was that for?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Shh, shh, shush, Morty. This is how we go. Bear it with grace.  Spinal cord, Robitussin as a base, then surprise me."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Mom!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Beth, maybe!"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Is she trying to say something?  We-we can't hear you! How dumb are ? Beth, you're in a vacuum, sound travels on air!  Why am I yelling?"
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,IS THIS A PRIVATE PARTY? OR CAN ANYONE JOIN?
6,Solaricks,Morty,Wow. Great.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yeah, that's ? Wow. Really worth it. That was not worth it! It's corny!  You! Corn! Dying of starvation here!"
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"WHEN I DECIDED TO SAY IT, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE ?"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Oh my God, stop explaining!  Stop explaining!"
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,? SUBJECTED TO THIS SCRUTINY.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Are you finished?  She's not finished.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,MAYBE I WON'T RESCUE YOU.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh, real mature!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Oh, nice."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Real classy.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"It was a good line, honey."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,I didn't need it to be. I don't care what you think.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Oh my god, she found you. Here, eat. Eat."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Oh hell yes!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Hold on, buddy. Our systems could go into shock from solid food.  Digestibot, convert to nutrient mass."
6,Solaricks,Rick,I'm just gonna risk it.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Since when do you guys get stranded?  Thank you, by the way."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Almost left them out there.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Portal travel's broken.  Mmm. Are these heirloom tomatoes? Digestibot, try these."
6,Solaricks,Digestibot,Yum. Yum.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,So you can't hop realities anymore? Does that mean you'll finally have to wash your robe?
6,Solaricks,Rick,Good point. They need to reboot the Portal Index immediately.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Basically just a hard reset on the fluid. Hold tight, the Earth's gonna shake a bit."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Uhh ?
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,Oh!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh, shit."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, what? What's happening?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Instead of resetting portal travel, I may have reset portal travellers. Too late to apologise."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Rick, why am I pulsing green? And don't say you don't know, because you're pulsing green."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Rick, are we about to die?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"No, we're about to vanish from this reality."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,That's totally dying!
6,Solaricks,Rick,No it isn't! It's everyone from this reality returning to their reality of origin.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Back to our original universes!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"I explained it fine, Morty. You're spoonfeeding spoons. Where is Summer?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Oh nice, you guys are back.  Whoa."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Summer, three of us are one-way blind-hopping. You gotta help us get back. There's a protocol for this in your chores server, filename 'Booger-Aids'."
6,Solaricks,Summer,Every file is 'Booger-Aids'!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"I?I hate naming things! Just search for words like 'one-way blind-hop, reset map beacon'."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,Why do I have a reality of origin?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"There's no time to explain, Jerry. Counting on you, Summer! One-way blind-hop beacon protocol.  Here we gooooo!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,So there was time to explain.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Don't waste extra precious seconds with your pettiness, Jerry!  Summer, let's run down?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"One-way blind-hop reset beacon, 'booger-aids'."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Cool.  Wow.
6,Solaricks,Jerry,There was so much time to explain!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yes, fine! Hindsight is 20-20. Who has ever taken this long to vanish?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"How did I end up not in my own universe?!  Oh, my god. The Jerryboree."
6,Solaricks,Rick and Morty,Oh! The Jerryboree!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Deep cut.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Wait, but where's our real dad and our real Morty?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Buried in the backyard.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,That's what the possums are after.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Dad's got you in the family business too, huh?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Yeah, Morty's an easy mark, but Rick pays me in things like ?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Wolverine claws.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Well, looks like you got this. See you guys in another?two years?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Or you could stick around for this one? Looks like it involves Grandpa's grotty citadel.  We could, you know, break things, loot stuff."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,I should ? probably get back to ? saving the galaxy.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Please?
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Guess I could loot some stuff. Fine. Yeah. Okay. Let's make it quick.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Awesome, I've never been. Let's do this. Okay. Adventure family. Woo!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Uhh ? Okay!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Fuck.
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this."
6,Solaricks,Voice,"Rick, is that you?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yeah, Diane."
6,Solaricks,Diane,You've been gone so long.  Did you find our daughter's killer?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Not yet, sorry. Still looking."
6,Solaricks,Diane,"You'll find him. You always do everything you set your mind to, except keep your family alive. But that was hardly your fault."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Mute.
6,Solaricks,Diane,"If I could be muted, I wouldn't be too-too-too good at haunting you, would I, you dirty bear?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Yeah. I forgot I wanted to be haunted.
6,Solaricks,Diane,"I guess you predicted you might. That's where haunting comes in handy, huh?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Very good point, sugar."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Rick?
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Hello? Original family? Sorry about last time. Rick, he was in space prison. We couldn't just?hello?"
6,Solaricks,Morty,Aaaah!
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Aw, geez."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Ah!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Oh!
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Agh! Ah, fuck! Dammit Morty, there's no doctors anymore."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Dad!?
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Figures it's underwhelming, the one time I visit."
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Yeah, sorry, usually, there's cowboy Rick and Mortys and stuff."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Looks like they could use a couple repairmen Ricks and Mortys, right?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Oh, tight! Little scavenger dudes. If they shoot at us, I'm allowed to ?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"do this.  Shit, yeah."
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Space Mom, get in on this!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Cool Mom.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Let's keep it moving. I don't have all day.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,I got it! I got it.  Sorry!  Sorry!  I got it. Sorry!
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,I was ? gonna do it ?
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Ugh, terrestrials, am I right?"
6,Solaricks,Diane,I kept up the search in your absence. You want a new list of potential locations?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"You're always just one room away, huh?"
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Yeah. Remember, if you thought you could see or touch me, it might give you a level of  com-com-comfort."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Right, can't have that. Come on, Summer."
6,Solaricks,Diane,Who's Summer? Should I be jealous? I hope  Summer knows what happens to the people you love!
6,Solaricks,Old Man,"Hey, Rick!"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Hey, Mr Goldmanbachmajorian. S-still alive, huh? What's up?"
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,"I was hoping you could help me make sense of a note I found this morning? It's written by someone claiming to be me. They say my mind is 'held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.'"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Right. I used to drink drink.  Uhh ? no clue pal.
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,That's okay. I found other notes in the trash just like it. Poor weirdo. I pity them. Wish they could let go and move on.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Sounds healthy.
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,Sure would be!
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,"Aaah, sweet death!"
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Was that symbolic? Are you letting go? I understand, baby. I forgive you!"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"You don't get to say that, you're not her! You're a thing I built to torture myself.  This whole fucking timeline is cursed. I gotta get out of here."
6,Solaricks,Diane,Because you want to move on.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Because I don't! And  I have to. I came back on accident. The guy I'm looking for, he's... he's not findable, Diane.  I live with a version of Beth now."
6,Solaricks,Diane,Sounds like a version of nice.
6,Solaricks,Rick,We have grandkids. That's who Summer is. She's going to get me out of here.  She reminds me of you.
6,Solaricks,Diane,Oh really? Is she dead too?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Bye, Diane."
6,Solaricks,Diane,"You're not honestly going to fly into that rift without coordinates, are you? Don't give up on us, Rick. I don't make the rules. Haunters gonna haunt."
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Baby, are you killing yourself?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,I'm more embracing the win-win of risking my life.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Where's Mom and Summer?
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Oh, they're gone. Sorry, Morty."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Gone gone?
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"We spent a long time in that ice. A gentle mutant licked us out, but Beth got sick and Summer... didn't thaw right."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"With no one left to blame, I finally had to deal with myself. Buried my grief at Barnes & Noble, ""Four Agreements"", ""Eat Pray Love"", Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"". Learned to accept things for what they are."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"In a few of these, the whole brain is still intact. Makes you wonder if some people were still in there,  just trapped in the horror. Anyway, it's awesome protein."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"I'm so sorry, Dad. But my real, original Dad beat the apocalypse. I-I-I guess we all underestimated you. Hey, w-what's that game we always try to play as a family, y?the one we never finished?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Downbeat.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Yes! Let's play Downbeat. I-I bet I can find it! We can finish now!
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Yeah, you should totally do that."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Hey, yeah, cool, I-I got it! We'll play Downbeat and we'll-we'll camp here tonight and then rebuild the house.  You know, we got food, fresh water, and we've got family."
6,Solaricks,Morty,The fuck?
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Morty. I wrote this note in advance in case you're wondering how I left so fast. My plan is to wait for you to turn your back, them I'm going to grab all your shit and split. Depending on how long you were out of the room, you'll probably be thinking I can't be that far away and you'll want to foll?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Morty, wrote this fast 'cause had to set trap. Thought you'd have cooler shit. See other note. Bye."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Motherfu?
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,Not cool! Oh!
6,Solaricks,Morty,"What the hell, Dad?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Don't take it personal, Morty. That's one of the Four Agreements. I don't remember the other three, but I know Commissioner Gordon was cool with Batman moving on."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Batman doesn't abandon people!
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,You abandoned us.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"I deserve that. But, you know, it... it improved you."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Oh, am I cool enough for you now? Well, that was easy, it only cost me fucking everything!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Whoa, hey, I-I?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"You came back and talked about us like we weren't people, Morty! Then you bailed and left us to freeze!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,I-I was apologizing for that earlier?
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Your mom and sister died, Morty!  And I moved on. From caring. And that is the best deal you will ever get. So take it."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Please don't go! I-if Rick comes back, we ca-we can find you a new reality. A new Mom, a new Summer, a... job!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Oh, you don't get it, kid. Except for this conversation, my life is perfect. Rick was always right.  Everyone needs to let go."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Aww, you came back. I guess we really did form a bond."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Ow! Hey, stop it! Get away from me!  No! Help!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Alright, pin dropped, Grandpa!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Come and get us.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Come on, come on, come on!"
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Baby? Something to keep in mind?if you were pulled home by whatever happened, it's likely our target was, as well. It's also likely he's having as much trouble leaving as you are."
6,Solaricks,Rick,He's trapped.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Grandpa!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh, fuck yes!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Grandpa?Grandpa?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Summer! Gold star, always believed in you. N-now the hard part."
6,Solaricks,Summer,Hard part?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Way worse things than me can see that beacon, too. Hunker down and protect it while I grab Morty. Rick out! Try to survive!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Oh, shit.  Domestic Mom should hide, maybe?"
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"""Domestic Mom?"""
6,Solaricks,Summer,"I mean, she's the cool space one."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Look, I'm not looking to get caught in whatever this is. You guys can both hide maybe, hash it out."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Oh, quit talking down. I'm you with the patience to do laundry."
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Mom, stop being jealous of our bond!"
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,She ran from our choices. I have to parent them.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,It's not like I didn't care. That's what the clone was for. Aah!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Moms!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Morty!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Rick? I knew it! I knew you wouldn't leave me!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Ow! The fuck?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Morty, did you see another Rick here? Nondescript haircut, sci-fi jacket?  Eh, of course you didn't see him, you'd be dead. Or you'd be a bomb. Do you feel bomby? Nah, you woulda blown up by now."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wasn't the Rick here dead? Th-th-that's why you pick places, right?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Uh, well, your Rick, uh, yeah, not dead, more like, not around. When I met you, I was sorta hoping he might turn up one day? You son of a bitch! I got you!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,W-w-where are we going?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"To kill your grandpa, little buddy."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, what?"
6,Solaricks,Morty,I don't understand. My original Rick killed your family? And you were just waiting for him to come back?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Seems like you understand fine, Morty. That was A re-piping.  We're here."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"This guy, Morty, he hates being found but loves building elaborate shit. Like-like-like playing a ton of Minecraft but all on a private server."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Am I in a fucking K-hole right now? What is going on?
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Whoa-ho-ho, you found me!"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"I shoot the first monitor, too. Listen, I'm not here. Or am I?"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"There's the clone you found! Or maybe it's me, all naked! Just a lil' Keyser S ze. I mean, why would I admit it's not?"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Oh-hoho, yeah! Look at him! Look at him go! Look at him dance! O-or me. Again, it might be me, like a ""Saw"" thing. I'm very sneaky. Here's a bunch of killbots to deal with while ya wrestle with that."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Obviously, I don't know who I'm talking to here."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,It's all prerecorded.
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"But if you got this far, you probably think you're real special. Tell you what?"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Oop! There he goes! Maybe that actually was me! If you follow him down there, we can do a big fight. Fifty percent chance I'm not lying."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"We're in trouble, asshole! I shouldn't have to beg."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, my moms are in trouble?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Those versions of them are.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"W-we gotta save them! Rick, this is an obvious trap. If you go down there he's just gonna kill you."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Good!
6,Solaricks,Morty,What?
6,Solaricks,Rick,Now what?
6,Solaricks,Morty,"If you don't care if you die, why do you care if I die?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Knock it off! Get out of here! You did this last season! You're like a suicide bomber!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Takes one to know one.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yeah, well, you get it from him, not me."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"I don't know him. You're my grandpa, Rick. Rick and Morty. A hundred years."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"This place totally might go up, by the way! Here's a bunch of countdowns! One of them's probably accurate."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Ah, fucking stupid 5th-dimensional stomach juices."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Sorry for the sitcom fight, and maybe getting us digested."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,You've got incredible timing.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Oh, don't be a bitch. I'm parenting. Makes sense you don't recognize it. You've been out of practice for a while."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Good! I'm glad that they have you! I don't want to be "Space Mom."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,You've made that clear. Just don't let Summer mistake your rejection of her for good taste.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,I'm not trying to. It's all her!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Jesus! It'd be cool if you were around more. I don't wanna get married. I'm 17. My affection is the wind. Don't try to compete for it.  I could hear every word of that through the helmets. Thank fuck I only had to kill most of them.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Jesus, that ship really has sailed."
6,Solaricks,Space Beast,And now... we feast!
6,Solaricks,Rick,This emergency was oversold to me.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Grandpa!
6,Solaricks,Home Beth & Space Beth,Morty!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Moms!
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, i-if they had to wear helmets?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,I do childproofing stuff while you're asleep.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Why don't you childproof Dad?
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Ah, great reminder."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Wait!
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,Time to get Jerry.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Ugh.
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,Maybe I wouldn't be so uptight if I wasn't married to an unemployed receptacle of human fear!
6,Solaricks,Summer 5126,"Get a job, Dad, it's been a decade."
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,"Whoof. Pretty brutal, Jer. I-I know a good alligator park if you wanna kill yourself."
6,Solaricks,Morty 5126,I got expelled today.
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,"What the hell, Morty?!"
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,"Oh, no, you got expelled. Whoa, what a horrible thing."
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,You are so fucking dumb!
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,"Too bad, Morty."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Hi, hon."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Whoof, some real Season 2 vibes in there, you know what I'm sayin'?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"You know, never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm glad we spent that time divorced."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Eh, one second."
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,I'll build a fucking swing set in the backyard!
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,What the hell Morty?
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"You know, I may technically be from here. But I'm a goddamn interdimensional traveller now, and all of you??can kiss my sci-fi ass."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,It gets me every time.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wow, what an amazing joke I just told. A-and also, what an adventure. You know, I guess it doesn't matter where we're from if we're together, huh? Good-good final moral thing."
6,Solaricks,Summer,This is everyone's original dimension now.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Great wrap-ups, kids."
6,Solaricks,Season 2 Jerry/Jerry C-131,"Ugh, you're back."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh shit, Season 2 Jerry!"
6,Solaricks,Season 2 Jerry,"Look, before you bust my balls, can someone help with the shower? It's colder than Beth on her anniversary. Also...  Look what I found in Rick's room!"
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Season 2 Jerry,"I don't care how cute he is, we agreed! No Boogens in the house."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Wait, Season 2 Jerry! Don't!"
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,Nyaah!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Oh!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Mr. Frundles!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Everybody in the car.
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Wait, but I thought he was Mr. Frundles."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Everybody in the car! Now!
6,Solaricks,Many species of Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Beth,What the fuck Dad?! Why would you bring that thing into our house?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"It was cute! Fuck we gotta find a new timeline now! You know how hard that shit is without portals? We gotta do the thing with the Rift and the beacon again! The whole fucking episode all over again! Car, fabricate some vomit bags."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Can't we just go back and fix it?
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,I can't believe portal travel's broken.
6,Solaricks,Rick,I'll get to it when I get to it.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Lift with your knees, Mom."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,How many times have you done this?
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Oh, God."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,And you swear they die of natural causes?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Mm-hmm, yep."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,The exact same as our old timeline? Even my stuff?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Bit of a rush job, actually, so they do say ""parmesan"" weird."
6,Solaricks,Morty,How do they say?
6,Solaricks,Rick,Par-mees-ian.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Boo.
6,Solaricks,Jerry,Jesus Christ.
6,Solaricks,Rick,I could've left you guys! You think the concept of family matters to me? I'm not even your Rick!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Uh-huh.
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"""I'm Denial Rick!"""
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"See you inside, Dad."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,Sorry I was such a Dance Mom about Summer. She's your daughter too.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"No, boundaries are good. But, uh, speaking of, maybe I've put up too many. Is it okay if I come around sometimes?"
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,That could be nice.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,That's a cute outfit.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,The one we always wear?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yes, Morty?"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"You promise I'm not, you know, bait? T-to make that Rick come back?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"What? M-Morty, for you to be bait, the guy'd have to value something. He truly does not give a shit.  He's the real deal."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Parmeee...san...
6,Solaricks,Rick,Par-meee-sian. Par-meee-sian.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Par...par-meee-sian.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Par-me-sian.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Gross.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Yeah.
6,Solaricks,Morty,I hate it.
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Hello? Morty? That one big Rat?
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Whoa, this is a development."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Gah!
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Shh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lil guy. Easy. You're a Jerry, right? Never got too close to the concept. Boy, you have really arc'd out."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Were you putting on pants?!
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"What?! Oh, yeah. No, I was naked to fuck with a guy. Speaking of, did you talk to me, or a little kid around here?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Maybe. Why? Because if you hate them, too... I could be down for a little team up."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Eh, I really don't ""team up"" anymore. Managing people, such a headache. Aah!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Fatality! Jerry wins.
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Oh, goddamn dude! Badass!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Why are you here?
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Buddy, I have been asking myself that exact same question."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, h-hold on, one sec, left a bag of funyuns down there last week. Didn't want to waste our time. Okay therapy me"
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Do you need to take that?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,No just the president
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Maybe we should turn off the phone
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Thought you might think it was cool.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,You like it when people think you're cool?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You're extra analytical today. Looking to remodel your kitchen?
7,Air Force Wong,President,Sanchez! I know you're in there when I call you directly it's an emergency.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,I was in therapy Don't stigmatize mental health
7,Air Force Wong,President,how rude of me Hello I'm the president
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Yes I recognise you
7,Air Force Wong,President,Oh? how nice
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,It's not nice to recognize a president can we go
7,Air Force Wong,President,In 1961 the CIA secretly relocated the loch Ness monster to lake Erie and replaced her bones with titanium she was then but by several werewolves giving us the ultimate anti submarine weapon
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Got it
7,Air Force Wong,President,But the Soviets smuggled in a reprechuan who turned Nessie's bones into silver giving her the were version of aids. She sank to the bottom we assumed she was dead but she was only asleep now she's awake and hungry.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You can't date my shrink
7,Air Force Wong,President,What?! Bro you're nuts
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Then don't date my shrink
7,Air Force Wong,President,I'm not dating your shrink! She probably doesn't even like me.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Tell him to stand down! Would you let him bang your therapist?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,What the hell does that even mean you don't believe in it?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"Don't date my shrink! And don't be a space Mormon! Why not?! It's silly! Sorry it's a cheap shpt. Worship how you want. I like Tom Cruise. Thank you. Therapy's working. Keep it in your pants. Ooh, welcome back to Mr. Stabby! Let's get another question from the audience!"
7,Air Force Wong,Audience member,Ow! Augh!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Mr. President.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"I've got an emergency, Rick. Another President mission? Y-You just killed the Loch Ness Monster for him."
7,Air Force Wong,President,Tell that little bitch to zip it.
7,Air Force Wong,Morty,You can't talk to me like that! T-Tell him he can't talk to me like that!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You can't talk to Morty like that. Whatever. I'll portal over. I've seen this one anyway. The audience dies.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Rick, thanks for coming. We've got a situation in the state of Virginia."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Bigfoot?
7,Air Force Wong,President,That's Montana.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Nazis?
7,Air Force Wong,President,"That's, uh...everywhere."
7,Air Force Wong,Carl,"That's an exaggeration, sir."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Jesus, Carl, you, too? The problem in Virginia is... love. You've heard the state motto, ""Virginia is for Lovers""? Well, now they've codified it into law. Virginia has declared itself literally and exclusively for lovers."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Sounds boring.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"It gets worse. There's no crime, no poverty, and suspiciously, no complaints. The governor just hit 100% approval rating. And that's worse? 100%? Get on the web, Dwayne. There's no such thing as 100% of anything. America knows and incinerates a cult when it sees one. But I can't do that to all of Virginia, so we need to infiltrate."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,I volunteer to do acid to prove I'm not a cop.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"No lone wolves. We need a crack team for this one. Rick, meet Fleeflak. He might be able to tell the future."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Might?
7,Air Force Wong,President,"We're waiting to find out. Onyx here is a weapons specialist, and our eye in the sky is my chief of staff bot, Chi-Chi. Sleek. Yes, an excellent team. Eh, but there's something missing... a psychology expert, perhaps."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"Oh, f ck me. You pretended to need a crack team so you could get Wong's number?"
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Get her number? I own the CIA. If I wanted, I could get her genome."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"So you wanted what from me, permission? You got it. It's a free country, so you're always saying. That's certainly all I'd be willing to pay."
7,Air Force Wong,President,You're making me choose? You or her?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,There's three billion women on this planet that have nothing to do with me.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Can you blame them?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You suck.
7,Air Force Wong,Fleeflak,Wait! Danger!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"Wow, that's great, buddy. It's goin' right on the fridge."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"I appreciate your lending your expertise to this mission, Dr. Wong. Gum?"
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"No, thank you. I was surprised to receive your call but excited. I haven't done field work since grad school."
7,Air Force Wong,President,We think the people of Virginia have become some kind of hippy s x cult.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"I haven't done that since grad school, either."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Ho-ho! Dr. Wong, you are a firecracker!"
7,Air Force Wong,Mayor,"Halt! I'm so sorry, Mr. President, Virginia is closed to visitors."
7,Air Force Wong,President,I thought it was for lovers. I'm a lover. You guys lovers? Mm-hmm.
7,Air Force Wong,Mayor,"I appreciate that, but the rest of your country doesn't need Virginia's love right now."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"You know, the last time a state talked that way, we had to have a whole thing."
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"And this time, the other side has nukes."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Well done, Doctor."
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Call me Helen.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Communist bastards.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Communist bastards! So, what happened? Tell me the secret."
7,Air Force Wong,President,How unsettling and cryptic.
7,Air Force Wong,President,finally your religion comes in handy! No! My only chance at meeting Will Smith!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Pick up your phone asshole when I call it's an actual emergency!
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Rick?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Unity
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Take it easy. Take it easy. I can explain just let me get things under control.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,you controlling things is the explanation and we agreed you wouldn't do it where I work
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,what the fuck are you spraying me with
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,A new scent I picked up after you left I call it "Separation'
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,You concocted a me repellent?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Does that look like a bad idea?
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Rick are you in a relationship with the population of Virginia
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,We dated
7,Air Force Wong,All,I just want to talk.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"I'm pretty sure you have trillions of cellphones. No, come back! Let's talk!  ?  ? Thank God you had a crack team with you."
7,Air Force Wong,President,Where's Helen?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"""Helen""?"
7,Air Force Wong,President,She initiated first name. Whoa! Call in a chopper! I'm being cock blocked!
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Rick... it's me. I was released from Unity.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Cool. So you won't mind if I spray this.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"I won't, but we're surrounded and Unity knows your reload time. I really believe you and Unity should talk."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,How would you know? You're just a nutritionist.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"When you work in nutritionism as long as I have, you get a certain feel."
7,Air Force Wong,All,Calm down. We came because we're worried about you.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Why?
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,"We hear things, Rick. I tried calling, but is it true you're looking for...him again? You almost died last time."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,That's none of your business.
7,Air Force Wong,All,You're our business.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You quit that business! And you're fired from that business! And I'm using your last paycheck to cover the stapler you stole which was my heart!
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Civil War, baby!  Sorry! That was supposed to be suppressive!"
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"Thank you, Andre."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Thank you, Helen. It's time to put these bastards on ice. Cue up the dome!"
7,Air Force Wong,President,You'll need a second date for that answer.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Barf.
7,Air Force Wong,News Anchor,"A nation in turmoil tonight as the entire state of Virginia continues to be trapped inside an energy dome. The White House released a statement dismissing the President's shouts of ""Civil War, baby,"" as hyperbole. Shonda, what do we make of that? More like Hyper Bully, Tom. Oh, sh t. Shonda came to play."
7,Air Force Wong,Shonda,"This President has been in office for how many alien invasions? Not to mention the mutant turkeys, the abandoned White House orbiting our planet, the eco-conscious dinosaurs. Then he sees Virginia with its perfect economy and synchronized lawn mowing, so he shoots them and puts them in a dome? Classic Curtis."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Will someone mute the goddamn news? If I want a list of my failures, I'd dig up my mother. I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry, that's a turnoff, right?Guy screaming about his mother in a war room? Sanchez! America hates your dome! How long is it going to be up?"
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"Rick, I agree that my accepting this mission was inappropriate. When I was invited, I didn't know --"
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,That he was hitting on you?
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,I was aware of potential romantic motivations. And I was open to them. Bam. But I did not know you and I would be crossing paths.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"You mean you didn't care because, on one hand, you got professional ethics and, in the other hand, you got world-famous schlong."
7,Air Force Wong,President,Now I get to beat you.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Bring it.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Put it through.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"You couldn't. You suck. I'll do it. Mr. President. Lady, you bring that ship to America's planet, I'm launching 4,000 warheads, 3,000 of which will turn out to work. Then I'll call China, and you're really f ck d."
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,"You've made it clear can't be friends, Rick, but I need to reconnect those people so I can properly release them. They're hosting a mindless collective. If it connects to another mind, it could become its own colony."
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,"I needed you to understand how serious this is. I can handle it. We got the spray, b tch!"
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Don't talk to them like that.
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Do you not trust me Rick?
7,Air Force Wong,President,Who would?!
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Let Rick answer.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Baby I know you want to help but-
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Andre I think we need to move slower.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Slower? I haven't even touched you, and you're already back seat war rooming."
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Andre.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Helen.
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Rick?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"I don't trust you. You ghosted me to focus on your work. Your work is absorbing the universe. But it's my universe. Please go. Well spray the Virginians before they touch anyone. I'm sorry you lost a finger, but that's the price of surprise butt play Goodbye"
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Goodbye
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,A "rake situation"?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"Long story short, I asked Gene if he borrowed my rake, and he said, ""No,"" like...like that. Like, too fast. Like, faster than someone should know they don't have my rake. I think he has my rake, and I..."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"No surprise there. All that brain, and you just waste it."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,H-Hold up. I-I waste my brain?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"Yeah, Rick. Obviously you were born smarter than me. But if I had your brain....but if I had your brain... - If you had my..."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,Are you gonna kill me?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"I was born crying and pissing myself, just like you. Then I become the smartest man in the universe, and do I get credit? No, I get to check my brain privilege."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,So we're swapping bodies?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"No, that would be ""Freaky Friday,"" which is the ceiling of your grasp of consciousness. The brain is part of the body, Jerry. It's hardware. I'm gonna put my mind in your brain and your mind in my brain. Then we'll see the real definition of ""waste,"" Jerry. Or, you know, admit genius isn't random and your failures are your own."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Oh, furck. Oh, grod."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Wait, no!"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Oh-ho-ho, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"All right, Jerry, you can do this."
7,The Jerrick Trap,GARAGE AI,Medical emergency detected.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,"I'm telling you, man, you're making a big mistake here."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,Y-You guys have milkshakes?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Your body? Jerry, your mind did that to my body using my brain. Jerry, my mind was in this brain in your body. Pretty easy to follow."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,It shuffled us.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,Shuffled you maybe. I'm tracking everything.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,Garage? Fix this.
7,The Jerrick Trap,GARAGE AI,Situation was fixed.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,So that's where my paranoia went.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,Rick speaking. Who is this?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Chuxly,"Rick, it's Chuxly. From Crimetown."
7,The Jerrick Trap,RICKBODY,"Wait, w-what? Aren't you describing kidnapping?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Give me that, Jerry. Hello? Hello?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,This is Rick Sanchez. I'm using my son-in-law's vocal cords because I'm amazing.
7,The Jerrick Trap,CAR AI,Figure out how to drive me together
7,The Jerrick Trap,GOON,"Looks like he's inbound, boss."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"This is my... assassin. Deadliest man in the galaxy, and he's gay."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,Why am I gay?
7,The Jerrick Trap,GANGSTER,Whoa.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,Why is Dad here?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Cruxly,Your dad's a gay assassin? So cool and ordinary. Sorry. S-Sorry.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"It doesn't matter, Rick. The guy's already kissing your ass."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"It's the ass kissers you have to keep in line. When they sense weakness, they move on you."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Cruxly,"Actually, Morty, why don't you leave those crystals here since it's such an insulting amount."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Look, here's the deal. I'm Rick, that's my son-in-law, and we're all a little gay."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,"T-They made us stop at every drive-thru chain in the galaxy, so they could make one giant burger with a patty from each place."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,I guess I meant before that.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,And Jerry'd still be hung up about the rake.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,Kinda thought two geniuses would build faster than one. When do I start being concerned about this?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Just having a little fun with my new friend, sweetie."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,Who is talking to me right now? Mostly my dad or mostly my husband?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Oof, I've been on that website."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,"Look, I've been patient, but I can't tell how to get mad at who. No one enters my room or touches me until this is wrapped up."
7,The Jerrick Trap,CONSTRUCTION WORKER,"Beautiful day to be carrying glass, huh?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,BOTH,Life tastes better when you're chugging.
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRYBODY,"Forget it, Burger."
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRYBODY,"Whoa! - RICKBODY:  Oh, man."
7,The Jerrick Trap,DRINKBOT,: somewhere.
7,The Jerrick Trap,MAN,The voice mailbox for...
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRY,"Uh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Did it beep?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,CHUXLY,Just an average mid-tier crime dork.
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRYBODY,We've smoked most of what we stole.
7,The Jerrick Trap,BETH,Jerry?
7,The Jerrick Trap,MORTY,Rick? Grandpa?
7,The Jerrick Trap,BOTH,Morty. Summer. Daughterwife. You are safe now.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,Yes. I am Jerricky. Wa-chah!
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,Do you not hear the symphony of atoms dying in space?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Gene,"'Scuse me. Are... Are you Jerry? Sorry, you have one of his heads."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,I am Jerricky.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Gene,"May as well have your rake back, then. That's right. I took it. I ask myself, ""Why lie about it? Don't you think he knows? Couldn't I get my own?"" Of course I could've,"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Summer,"Well, it's fucking lame, okay? Both of you walking out on Mom? I thought you had two sets of balls, not zero."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,Our balls are adeq...
7,The Jerrick Trap,Summer,Hold him down!
7,The Jerrick Trap,MORTY,Garage! Garage! Help us! Hold him down!
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Jerry, being shuffled with me was probably the best part of your sad existence. A brush with greatness."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Hey, Beth, how much integrity is left on the mortgage?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,Dumb. fucking dumb. Go pick up crystals for me.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"You don't have to do that, Morty."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,"No, it's... it's okay. I-I like doing it."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,"Welp, those horses won't sew themselves up, but good to have you both back. Yeah. Whatever."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Great, so I still wind up stuck with Jerry's dumb ass?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"Oh, fuck you. Eat your eggs that my wife bought."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"How about you eat my shit, you Hawaiian-shirt-loving twat?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,Uncalled for! Rude and uncalled for! You sit there with your potty mouth
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Jerry, it's not my fault that nobody respects you in here. Oh, yeah."
7,The Jerrick Trap,MEMORY RICK,Day of attempting to escape Jerry's mind.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Oh, good, are we having this fight again? L-let me guess, y-you?re gonna leave or, or throw a sulking fit?"
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"You think you know everything, Rick, but you?re basically just a giant 8-year-old."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"I?m not doing this anymore. Either you?re in or you?re out, Morty. I?m tired of you weaponizing this half-assed threat. You want out, then fucking quit!"
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"You know what, you?re right. Sorry to be such a high-maintenance Morty. Why don?t I get you a drink?"
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Hey, Rick. You drunk yet?"
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"You?re my little buddy,  you know that? I-it?s you and me, Morty. Rick and Morty, 100 years. Forever."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Yeah, pal. Rick and Morty, 100 years. Forever."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,G-g-get off me. W-w-what are you doing? Ahhhh!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,An eye patch? You know how we feel about pirates.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Rick,Do your worst you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Ahh, just another day in paradise."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Motherfucker!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Well, not the stealthiest technique, but if this guy doesn?t know I?m hunting him, he?s not worth hunting."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"It?s just good to see you outside the subbasement. Even if you never kill the version of yourself that killed your wife. Giving it your best shot, it looks good on you."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Thanks, buddy. It means a lot that your bar for mental health has gotten lower than mine."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Merging dimensions to consolidate my decoys, huh? Kind of? first-thought, but the? craftsmanship, pretty impressive. For a lesser Rick."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,What the fuck are you doing?
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Oh, shit! Evil Morty! Sho-should I grab the net?!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Yes! Hang tight, Morty?s getting the net."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Wait. Is this what I think it is? Of course it is. Everything?s what I think it is. You?re basically fracking the Central Finite Curve to flush out a version of yourself? Shouldn?t you be turning yourself into a pickle?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,What do you care what I do to the Curve? I-I thought your whole gimmick was fucking off. Certainly what made me a fan.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"You?re right, I don?t live here, which is why it?s insane that you?re still bugging me."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Why would I touch it when I don?t want it improved?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Improved?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,You?re hitting infinite targets. At least filter for probability stasis.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I was gonna. Duh.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,I can?t find the net! Sh-should we just shoot him?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,You really think a douche that smug doesn?t keep a force field on?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Yeah, listen to Pop-Pop, Morty."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Eh. I?d be an idiot if I didn?t check.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Uh-huh.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,He?s filtering for probability stasis.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,You?re acting like this one?s different.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He is different. But different doesn?t mean him. Could be a trap.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I?ll explain. He?s worried that it?s actually your target and he?d owe me credit for the kill.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Are you serious right now? You little narcissist.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Dude, literal glass house."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,You think you?re better than me?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Jesus, I hope so!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Can I offer my two cents?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Everybody look at the bright side. Evil Morty got to experience being wrong before he died.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"It?s true, that?s what I get for talking to you instead of killing you."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,What is this place?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I assume a box to contain Ricks that get too close to the big guy.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Are you basing that on what you?d do? Since you?re all the same.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I?m basing it on the ensemble of thematic Ricks huddled opposite your POV.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Instead of Ricksplaining how we all ended up in a Roach Motel, let?s pool some data. Who got here first?"
7,Unmortricken,All,We know.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Looks like there?s enough of you to start the next ride! That or just one really heavy Rick. This whole thing is automated, which I do point out specifically to enhance the humiliation. Here we go!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"If you?re seeing this, you?re me, except, you know, less. But you acted like you were better, so I killed your beloved Diane. Partly to devastate you, mostly so I only have to record one message. Some of you may have noticed that it?s not just your Diane that?s gone. She?s also been erased from every universe across infinity. And you might be wondering why."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I?d rather hear how.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Diane was wiped from all existence by The Weapon Too Cool for a Name.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,The Omega Device.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Known to inferiors as The Omega Device.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I heard the name from an inferior.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"And it?s my weapon. But it?s your fault I had to use it on her. So if you want to see the Rick that ruined your life, look around. There?s so many of you. But that?s why I want to make a deal. One of you is going to get your Diane back."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He?s lying. He?s lying!
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,All you have to do is be the last Rick left.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Got that out of your system? He can?t bring her back!
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Eh. Pass.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,You?re such a dick! We could?ve worked together!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I thought you wanted to ?work together.?
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Just until you could kill him!
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,And they call me Evil Morty.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,The easiest way out of any box is to be the least shaped like a box. We both hate Rick Prime more than each other anyway.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Where?d you get that?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He?s the worst Rick.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Big deal. The worst turd is a pizza.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Seems like he doesn?t play well with others. We all cool just killing this guy?
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Great job, final Rick! Or if you were just one fat Rick, impressive cardio! And now the big reveal. Do you get Diane back? Not in any real sense, because when I build a weapon, it works. It?s called being talented. But I do have a Diane that promises to be with you until death. But I?d get to the death part fast. You don?t want to be in here when this place resets."
7,Unmortricken,Diane,Rick?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Hey, Diane."
7,Unmortricken,Diane,You sucked at eating pussy!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Clearly just said to be hurtful, but I also won?t deny it. I was young."
7,Unmortricken,Diane,I always thought your dick smelled weird!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Or that.
7,Unmortricken,Diane,"Come on b-baby, g-give my g-ghost a k-kiss. Mwah."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I?m excited for this. Clearly no one?s escaped that place before.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Really learned your lesson about chasing this guy.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Hey, man, you can leave now."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"That?s true, I can."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"The weapon, Morty. He knows a thing that wipes someone out across all dimensions could wipe him out across all dimensions. Holy shit."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Can?t help it, I?m a rascal. Morty, you can?t come! Evil Morty, stay out of my way! Gonna kill my nemesis! Rick out!"
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,He?s a weird guy.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,So Rick?s right? You?re afraid of the weapon?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,What happens if Rick actually kills this guy? You ever think about that? Maybe he?ll kill himself next.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,You?re an asshole.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Well, yeah. I?m not ?Good? Morty. Come or don?t. I don?t care."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Oh. Shit.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Got to be honest, I totally thought you were coming."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"No, no, I- I was. I-I took a heroic step toward the portal, but then it closed."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Yeah, yeah, come on."
7,Unmortricken,A.I.,What?s up?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He built it again.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Well, yeah, he?s me with free time. Alright, I don?t see a place to park. Catch your breath and then keep that heat off my back."
7,Unmortricken,Car,"If you die, I?m taking your stuff."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Ugh, gross."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,What? No one can do undercuts but you?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,You brought Morty?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I?m not worried about him. I?m evil!
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Alright, here we go!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Wow, the Wife Guy! Dead Wife Rick! I?ll tell you, this guy does not know when to quit."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I?m gonna fucking kill you.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,You brought two Mortys with you? What? They?re your cheering section?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"We brought ourselves, asshole."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Honestly, Wife Guy, I do miss when it was just us. The only two Ricks who actually invented portal travel. Anyone else teed up to arrive later? Like your car?"
7,Unmortricken,A.I.,I can see why you hate him.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"And she sounds like our wife! Like in a fucked-up robot way but that?s definitely her voice. You sentimental little fella. Right, good instincts. I would?ve tried that, too. I upgraded this thing, by the way. The new version can fire more than once. So now I can erase your whole family, one-by-one, until you finally learn your lesson. Which you won?t, so then I?ll kill you, too."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"I?ll do that the old-fashioned way. Okay, family killin? time! Let?s start small. Still family though."
7,Unmortricken,Slow Mobius,Where am I? Two Ricks? Where?s my wife? I was just with my wife!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Uncle Slo!
7,Unmortricken,Morty,What the? Uncle Slo? Slo Mobius?
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Yeah, this one hurts me, too."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,No-o-o-o-o-o!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I?ll kill you!
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"So, uh, original grandson. This is super weird. Obviously we?re, uh, both trying to kill each other."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Aw, jeez. Nice to meet you, I guess."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"So, do we? should I just get this over with or??  Cool grandson."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Shitty grandpa.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Why am I wearing an eye patch? And wait. Did we? did we switch shirts?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Yeah. Thanks for the assist.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Rick, we? we did it. Evil Morty got him! Rick? Rick!"
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Alright, you two punks stay here."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Okay, I think I?m getting the pic? Ow! Frying my backups, smart. So you?re like an evil Morty. A clever one. Ow! Alright, never been a sidekick guy, but I?m starting to see the value. You want a job? We could be like Batman and Robin."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Eh, I don?t need a Robin."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Okay, seriously, what is this? What, are you gonna ?aw-jeez? me to death? Oh, you don?t want those schematics, buddy. Those are for grown-ups."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Uh-huh.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Oh, isn?t this great? Okay, alright. I get it."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Oh. What? Oh, shit."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Mm-hmm. Knock yourself out.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Listen, Rick to Rick, he?s got the weapon plans. Buddy, nip this in the bud. He?s 14. What?s gonna happen the next time he gets mad at grandpa?"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Let?s do this then. You?re welcome, by the way. I made you. I showed you infinity."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"And what did you do with it? Hang out with my grandson, raise echoes of my daughter?"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,What?s your life without me?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Let?s find out.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Admit it. You would?ve been me.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,I just walked into your garage before you walked into mine! But eventually you did! You lived in my house!
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Rick! Is it over? Is? is he??
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Not exactly an ?alive? amount of blood. How?s it feel? Better? No? Exactly the same? Yeah, it always does. Hope you?re happy with your choice."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Fuck off.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I?m gonna. Just don?t force me to improve on the design. I can end the Rick experiment any time I want.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Why threaten? Why not just do it?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Because using a weapon like this doesn?t get you left alone, Morty. Think I want a bunch of vengeful Summers coming after me? You are a little different though, Rick. Maybe I can use that someday. Seriously though. Fuck you. Don?t come after me. It won?t go well."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Are? are you okay?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Yeah.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Phew, man, when those drones uncloaked back there, I was like, ?Oh, shit, this is? We?re fucked, we?re toast!"

5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,"Rick, Morty, and Summer","Boob World! Boob World! It's a world for you, but it's actually two. Boob World!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I gotta say, Morty, it's weird that you wanted me to come, but I'm actually ""exstyched"" about it. That's ""excited"", ""stoked"", and ""psyched""."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I didn't want you to come. Talk to Rick.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Truth is, Summer, Boob World's been at the center of a few protests every day for 30 years, so they've recently rebranded as a ""boob empowerment experience"", and if we bring a female, we get in for free."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"So, I'm like, what, a Coke can you're taking to Six Flags?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"No, 'cause once you get into Six Flags, you can throw your Coke can away."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,No fuckin' way. It can't be.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, look at that."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,What is it?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,A Gotron Ferret.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"It's not a Gotron Ferret, Morty, it's THE Blue Gotron Ferret!  Boob World is canceled."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"No! Rick! No, you promised! You always do this."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Tell you what, Morty, I'll let you choose, do you really think Boob World "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Yes.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Let me finish.  is more important 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Yes!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Let me finish!  than having all five of the only five Gotron Ferrets in the universe?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Are you finished? Yes! So let's go.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Summer, help me hook the winch up to the ferret."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Sure.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,What the hell? You said you were letting me choose.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Yeah, whether to break my fucking heart. You chose badly."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,That's how it all began. To my sister it was just another game. But what she didn't know 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,That was the moment everything changed.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Wait, what?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"I had gotten my first taste of respect, and my first voiceover."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,I can hear you. Can you hear me?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"And I knew then and there, I wanted more of both."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,Hello?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Beth, Jerry, do something fun with us! A giant monster's attacking in the Nibblenug system. Your suits are in the bathroom."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Mine smells skeleton-y.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,I have a chiropractor appointment.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,What are you involving us in?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Rick's been collecting Gotron Ferrets, and now that he has all five, he can combine them into "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Morty, for Christ's sake, spoilers!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Spoilers, Morty! We don't need to sell this to anyone, there's a giant monster attacking."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"In the Nibblenug system. Since when does this house care about alien lives, we don't even watch"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Told you. Let's just get Gene from next door and a homeless guy.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"No, hold on, fuck Gene, fuck the homeless. Your kids and their grandpa are asking you to do an activity with them, when did that stop being a parent's wettest dream?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,I guess around the time our family created a giant incest baby and the government launched it into space.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Oh my god, we made a giant incest baby. Oh my god, you might be a clone. I exist because you guys failed to abort me. We get the family we get, not the one we want, and if you want to keep the one you got, get your asses into some anime spacesuits!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Fair enough.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Okay.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Good work, Summer-camp."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Yeah, I'm ""excitoked"" about this."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Sure you are. Now.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Something new was forming, and I was at the bottom of it."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"I let Morty have his voiceover, it's really all he had left."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Okay, can you hear me, or not?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"You mean, can I, Summer, hear you? No, my voiceover can hear your voiceover."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,What's the difference?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"One would be telepathy, dumbass."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Now what?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Now we 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,"Rick, Morty, and Summer",Go Team Gotron!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Where are we zip lining through futuristic metallic tunnels to?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Each robot ferret is on a different location on Earth. You're going to the center of a volcano.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Thank... you?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Okay, well, this isn't not fun."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Regroup on me, I'll shoot a portal to Nibblenug."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Did I just monorail from my kitchen to Hawaii just to regroup in outer space above my kitchen?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Uh, Summer?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"It's cool, Dad, shut up."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Everybody, attack one at a time."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Is that the best way to 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Tee up something awesome? Yes. Follow me.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Guys, we did our best, but there's only one hope. Activating linkdock, intermorphs, ratify, postatrinos, maximize."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Holy shit, I can't believe this is working. Go, Go-Team! It's Gotron Time!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Oh, my god. Hell, yes!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,This is amazing!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Okay, now we can knock it around a little bit, but trust me, we're still building to something."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,How do we 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Just hit buttons, we're too big to fail!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Wooah! I kicked him, that was me, right?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Uppercut!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,I can't believe I almost went to the chiropractor.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,I've been waiting a long time for this. Form Luminous Energy Sword!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Got your ass, mamma-jamma!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, that was fantastic!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"...tits, Grandpa."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Suck tits!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,I was a foot! I was a goddamn  foot!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"We were like, ""Bwaaah""!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"'Member when the sword was like, ""Bwaaah""?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I feel so alive!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"These were the good times, when we felt like we could do anything. But anything is never quite everything, and pretty soon..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Tch, that was nothing. Nothing compared to what I can do. There are infinite universes where I still don't have all five ferrets. Those versions of me would do anything to complete their collections."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Okay, but Rick? Remember what you told me to remind you? Sometimes enough is..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Sometimes enough is enough.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Morty, what are you doing?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"He gets obsessed, Summer."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,When are you going to find your shame?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I have more?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Grandpa just gave everybody the high point of their lives, and before he did, every single one of you was trying to talk him out of it."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Wait, yeah. What the fuck?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Now he says we can go higher, and big surprise, it's time to drag him down again."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Well, I vote."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"No voting, no debate, it's not a democracy, it's a Rick-public. You're in or you're out."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Obviously, I'm in, I never said I wasn't in."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Me, neither. Tell us what we're doin' next!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,I want to put together a cookout.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,That's it? I was honestly prepared to blow someone.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Jerry.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"I said prepared, and someone."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Rick invited five versions of our family from different universes, each with incomplete Gotrons. I didn't have anyone to talk to, since the other four Mortys had been to Boob World."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty 1,Did you walk on the beach?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty 2,The beach that's all boobs?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty 1,"No, the beach that's all sand. Yes, the boob one!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Rick was in the garage with the heads of the five families. ...Ugh, and Summer."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"In that first sit-down, it was Big Fat Rick; Ricardo Montoya; Hothead Rick, he got that name because he was prone to dramatic outbursts; and Little Ricky Wrap-it-up, who was always great at the end of a meeting. At the head of it all: me, and Grandpa Rick."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,"Eh, don't get me wrong, C-137. We're happy for your good fortune, but we did not travel to your universe just to have it rubbed in our faces."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"C'mon, Big Fat Rick, you know your face is too small to rub anything on."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,My face is the same size as yours.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Wow, huh. Hold on."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"I'll be damned. You're so fat, it's an optical illusion. Summer, give him the pitch."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,We're offering to help each of your families complete their full Gotrons.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,Gabaloccia!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Ricardo Montoya,...what?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,In exchange for some concessions.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Ricardo Montoya,Ever since I was a little boy in the slums I have dreamed of having a complete Gotron. But concessions? I hope you mean the kind from a counter. I hope she means ice cream!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,Gabalo-guccia!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"We'd like you to move your families to this universe and let me make some modifications to the Gotrons, in the interest of us all working together."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,Wanna know what I think?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Sure, Hothead Rick. Just don't unexpectedly fly off the handle."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,I think you guys got a lotta nerve actin' better than us! This is the family that made a giant incest baby! Had the government launch it into space! It's still floatin' around out there somewhere!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Are we ever gonna live that down?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,When I get a full Gotron it won't be by kissin' your ass! It'll be by takin' what's mine! Yours!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Hey, gross! No need."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,And you were driving a ferret?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,"We all are, moron! Gimme the key!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,"You'll regret this, you level-headed fuck!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Obviously, we predicted that might happen, which is why we have Yo-Yo Rick on standby."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Anybody got beef with Yo-Yo?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Ricardo Montoya,"Eh, I'm okay. I'm okay with that."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,"Good, that's good."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Some people think he's lame, but to me, he's lame in a cool way, because he owns it. Cool. That concludes business. Little Ricky Wrap-it-up?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,"Raise 'em up, boys! Opa!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"And so we helped our people find their ferrets. How they got 'em, not our problem."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"Then we got down to business. Here's how it worked. If a giant monster attacked our planet, y'all got the alert."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,We formed five Gotrons. And those Gotrons formed the Gogotron.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Smith family,"Go, Gogotron!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,I will never get sick of this!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"If you were a giant monster at that time in our universe, you never had a chance!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Yo-Yo Rick,Mine needs a weapon like a yo-yo. And a yo-yo on the chest. Are you listening to me? I need you to respect this partnership!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"I kept Rick removed from the ugly stuff. If you got in his way, I got you out of the way."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,And that made more room to move up.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,The head of my right arm.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Me, I ended up the left foot of the left foot, I guess because our robot didn't have an asshole."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"Well, it had one."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Bitch! When are you going to stop breaking my balls? You win, okay?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"We're not competing, Morty. And there's your answer. I could move you up if I could trust you to put family first."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,How is that putting family first?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Show me all the blueprints! Show me all the blueprints!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I agree, that's an issue. Big Fat Rick, his flask stays full, or your locker gets emptied, thanks."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"I know it feels good when he likes you, but that doesn't mean him liking you makes you good."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Solid babble, Morty, like a fortune cookie written by Borat."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Yeah, I'm not as smart as you, that's why I know you know what I mean."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"You mean if I really loved my family, I'd give control of it back to your jealous ass? Green Ferret 4 needs a wash and we're out of detergent."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I just bought a box.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,And Grandpa snorted it because you make him feel fenced in.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Sum-sum!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Get two boxes.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"We evacuated one of the planets we saved and found a secret nightclub on it. A place no enemies could find us, unless you count my brother."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"I didn't even have my own ferret anymore. Summer made me somethin' called an ""Associate Security Chief"", whatever the hell that means."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Look at this guy. Ha-ha. And look at this guy. Look at this guy over here!  Meow-meow-meow, meow, meow-meow!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Oh, there she is, my baby princess, get up here. Stop the music!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"This is our queef  our queen. She saved my life, she set me free, we wouldn't have what we have without this crazy bitch. And she's got a special announcement.  Summer, tell 'em what we talked about."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Now? I don't think 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Okay, I'll do it, goddamn."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"The new job did have some perks, like I got to be around the night Summer realized she was in over her head."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Yeah, okay. I've got 90 extra ferrets, which means I need 10 more, and then 4 of you get your own Gogotron, and 20% of you get a Gotron, 'cause we're all gonna have a fuckin' Gogogotron!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,He's very excited. Um...
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, I hate my family."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,You should. Get in.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"How's it going with your grandpa's compulsiveness? Is your sister still enabling it, huh?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Who are you people?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 2,"Let's just say, we're the rightful owners of these ferrets."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Then why were they scattered and buried across the universe?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"We mean, in a more general, cultural sense, ehh!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"What your grandpa did is called appropriation! Not cool, heugh!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Look, Morty. We've been watching. We know you're the one that knows what's best. Work with us from the inside. Help us take over this operation. We're literally designed for it, mm-hmm?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 2,"Nobody will know it was you, then you can get back to what's important."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Are those Boob Bucks?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Legal tender at every kiosk and ride, huh?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"I can't. Summer's treating me like shit, but, she's still my sister."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"That's really noble, Morty. If you were in our family, your loyalty would be rewarded. But you're not in our family, which means we can kill you."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, yeah?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"And sure enough, just when I stuck my neck out for the family, it got stomped on, anyway."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Rick!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Mom! Dad!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,"Hothead Rick, baby!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,Aaaugh! I set myself up for that! Aaugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,What the hell happened?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Hothead Rick.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,How did he get so close to us?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Morty was supposed to be security.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Morty!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"I stepped away, all right? But not to let that happen!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Morty! We're not attractive strangers next to you on a flight to Paris traveling alone to get over a breakup, so this is no time to be coy!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Little Ricky!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,"I'm all wrapped up, Summer. Ohh..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Guys, I know you don't trust me, but what have we become? Why are we doing this anymore?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Because it's fun, you little rat! Now go home and play video games while we clean up these bodies, or your mother and I will hire people to break your knees!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"This is $16,000 we got from the Deep State for stepping on that trailer park. It should be enough for school, lunch, and home repairs. Now I gotta turn my back on you."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,No!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"With Morty out of the way, things were looking up. But looks aren't everything."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,New Jerry,"Hi, Summer. Umm, my cockpit's not getting Wi-Fi..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Dad, you know that's not what I do around here."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,New Jerry,"Oh, I'm not your dad. I'm a version of him, and this is my first day here, I'm not sure what you do around here."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Then, fuck off."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,New Jerry,"Oh, fuck you."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Excuse me? I want your ID.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Mom. Are you Mom? Can you control your working Jerrys?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Working Beth,"Sweetie, we're all a little overwhelmed."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Good point. You're not a war-time mom, why don't you find your version of Dad and take a break, take a holiday?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I don't have time to wait for your confirmation, so let's just say, if you're here in 10 minutes, I'll have you removed."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,And then the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Couple of snags, but I know how to speed things up."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Remember how we talked about how the best thing we could do for the family is recruit from outside the family?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Yes, way ahead of you. Summer, I want you to meet Kendra."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"She's from a temp agency. She's got an entire workforce ready to go, and all of them have previous giant robot pilot experience. So, we'll be ready to go ahead of schedule."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Well, I don't know about that, but..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Well, Kendra knows, so."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,So...
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,You're here to break my legs?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"No, we're here to talk shit about your sister, because she just fired us."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,You're kidding.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Arrogant little bitch.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Should we clip her?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"No, she's not worth doing time."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,You wouldn't do time. You brought her into the world.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,So I can take her out. You thought that was an actual law? It's a joke mothers say. What kind of fucked-up world have you been living in?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Uh, one where your mother murdering you isn't a comedic premise?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Guys. There's a little adjustment period, but pretty soon you're gonna return to normal, and you're not gonna wanna kill Summer, you're not even gonna be mad at her."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Nah, fuck her. She's my enemy."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Should we kill ourselves so we can get to hell before her and hide near the entrance?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Hmm, I like that."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Rick fired me.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Aww, baby..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Aww, sweetie..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,I'm sorry.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Are you okay, baby? What happened to us? We lost our minds."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,I did it. Morty was right. I got addicted to making Grandpa happy.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,It's only because your grandpa inflates the value of his happiness.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Eh, that's a good point. I mean, look at me, I'm easy to make happy, which is why nobody gives a shit if I am."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I appreciate it, but there's something else, too. I've been really sensitive about family lately because of something I've been keeping secret."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Oh.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Okay, who's on the Supreme Court and what state do we live in, it's been years since I thought about this."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"No, I'm not pregnant, but as you guys recall, and as a lot of people keep bringing up, Morty and I did accidentally create a giant incest baby, which the government did launch into space. And, I'm not sure how to tell you this, but, it is still alive, and I have been in contact with it."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"There were soldiers waiting for me outside school last month, and they took me to the Pentagon and briefed me, and from there I was shuttled to a secret base on Mars. They had captured him and wanted to see if he'd respond to me. instinctively, being his mother. And he sure did, but what they didn't expect was that I'd respond to him. I was supposed to help discipline him so they could turn him into the ultimate weapon. Instead, I trained him to love, to believe in himself, and finally, to escape."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"The government doesn't want anyone to know it happened, but it's only a matter of time before the story comes out, and when it does, all we're going to have is each other, and you guys are a couple, and Rick has Morty, but I'm the odd one out, so I wanted to make sure we stuck together. But instead I drove us apart and Rick replaced me with an anime girl, so all I got is myself and my giant tortured government-trained rogue incest monster baby out there in space somewhere."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Aww, baby. Holy fuck. And then you have to wonder, what else are they doing with our taxes?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Wait, Summer, what did you just say?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Morty, a lot."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"He replaced you with an anime girl? Big eyes, plus signs for teeth, ends sentences with weird sounds that don't fit?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Yeah, and that's going to be his whole crew now, and they're about to run their first test on the Gogogotron."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Those people wanna steal the robot. They're gonna kill Rick! He's all alone, we've gotta go save him!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Right. Or, you know, fuck him."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,I'm good with that.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Yep. Fuck him.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Guys! A great leader once told me, you get the family you get."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Right. It works. Now we just gotta find a giant monster.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"My sensors have picked one up, Rick."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Okay, okay. Lock onto its location."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Yeah, got it. Oh, it's you!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Huh?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,What the hell is this?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Thanks for making the biggest robot ever, Rick. We'll take it from here. Haha!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,You little assholes!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,Ah! You son of a bitch!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,No!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Deuugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Lock and load, boys."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Say hello to my little me.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,Deagh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Ha-ha-ha-ha!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Yaugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Give up, old man. The G3 is ours. And last I checked, your family wasn't coming to save you, hmm?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Incest Baby,"Ga-ga, goo-goo!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,Holy mother of mercy!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"My God, it's beautiful."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Yeah, family!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,Is that
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"It's exactly what it looks like, yes."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"Congrats, man. I see the resemblance."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,Form the energy sword. Activate the goddamn sword!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, man. The sword? Maybe we didn't think this through."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"They're not actually gonna attack a space baby, are they?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I never thought I'd be the one to say this, but you need to watch more anime, Mom."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Whoa, easy now, Naruto."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Naruto,Momma go bye-bye.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"What the hell is wrong with you people? You just have an incest space monster in your back pocket, huh?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Welcome to the Smith family.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Shit. Put that down, Naruto. Your great grandpa is in there."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,What do you say? One last zip line?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Heugh.  Incest space baby, nicely done."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"After that, things pretty much went back to normal. Some version of it, anyway."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Rick said Gotrons were lame little kid bullshit, and we never talked about 'em again."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"Except all those gigantic space bugs were runnin' loose, and there were no Gotrons left to fight them."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Yeah, millions die every day."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,You wanna know what they could never kill? Family.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Help! Help! I'm still out here! Aaagh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Yep, nothin's more important than "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Hey! Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Eugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"And just like that, I knew our goose was as cooked as "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Voiceovarians. Eugh.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,"Somatski, you're late!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Somatski,Won't happen again! Sir!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,"Bugs! Look to your left. Now look to your right. None of you are coming back. Not one, in the entire history of this program, not a single bug has returned. All right, bring it in."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,What are we?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Bugs,Normal-sized bugs!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,What do we do?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Bugs,Travel through an interdimensional gateway to planets and tiny people!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,Why do we do it?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Bugs,To spread the cure for AIDS!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Palicki,"Hey, Sarge, how do we know if these little people can understand us? I mean, do they even speak Buginese?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,"Funny, Palicki. That's why we say it very loud. Guys, you'll still be the same civilized bug on their side. It's not like interdimensional travel strips us of our clothes and makes us screaming monsters. Or, maybe it does, impossible to know. Now get out of here!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Somatski,My clothes... Where'd they go?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Somatski,"OWW! Stop shooting me! Okay, here goes. ONE PART LEMON JUICE! FOUR BAY LEAVES! A PINCH OF SEA SALT!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Come on Rick, w-we're almost there."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,Leave me Morty. It's the only way.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,Wha-were-were we Blades in that one? That's fucking tight.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Just stay with me.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"I'm scared, Morty. I can see the end. I'm a silly man. I'm a small, silly man."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,I'm sorry I got you into this.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Then how about I get us out of this?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,Hello?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,I-It's Morty. From school.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Oh hey, Morty. What's up?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Um, I just want to say that you're really great and I'm sorry that the timing never really worked out with us, but you're really great and I wish I got to know you better."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Oh, I mean, that's a lot."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, I guess I just..."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"No, I just wish you'd said it sooner."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Wh-What?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Yeah, I mean being nervous is sort of selfish sometimes, you know?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Ship alarm,Life support systems failing.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Yeah, that's a great point."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Well, what are you doing tonight?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Tonight?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Yeah, do you, like, want to watch a movie or something?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Um, yeah, tonight. Sounds great.  Holy shit! Holy shit! Come on, come on!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"Ugh, where are we?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"We're home, Rick. I landed us in the ocean."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,The ocean? The ocean on Earth?!
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Uh, yeah, I guess so."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"Oh, shit. Holy shit. We have to go. We have to go right fucking now!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,What?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"You touched the ocean, Morty. Oh fuck! Shit!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Mr. Nimbus,Richard! You have desecrated the sacred treaty betwixt land and sea! Now face the wrath of your once and eternal foe... Mr. Nimbus!
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Sorry, who is that?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,My... nemesis.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,What?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"My fucking nemesis, okay?!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Okay, but what was his name again?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Mr. Nimbus,I am Mr. Nimbus!
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,He's gonna say that a lot.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You two are hungry.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Big day.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,We're gonna kill God.
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Come again?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Christian God is real, he's been asleep for thousands of years. We're gonna sneak up there and kill him."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Mob style.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Whack his ass.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Can I kill God?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Fuck off, Summer."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Pfft, as if!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Beth, do you hear this?"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Sweetie, don't get all worked up before your job interview."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Job interview?
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Yes, is that so hard to believe?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Actually, yeah. Something's off."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,No!
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Shit!
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,"Hunt me, hunt me, somebody hunt me!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Don't hunt him to completion!
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,Hunt me!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh. Shit. Everyone start packing, no time to explain."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Rick?
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Dad? What's wrong?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Someone just killed a decoy family.
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,I'm Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,You made clones of us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Decoys, Morty. Very different.  Very different, sweetie."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Different h-ow!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Yeah, dad. Different h-ow?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie. I'm cool, and it makes them feel bad. So, y'know, after that trouble with Space Beth, I made passable copies of the family and placed them around the country as a buffer zone to protect"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,But why does he always want to be hunted?
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Jerry
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"It's not important right now, dad!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family and place them all around the country, but fuck me if I have questions about the starfish man in a target suit."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,So thankful this is my Saturday.
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Why was he in that cryopod?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"The cryopod is what confuses you? Jerry, can't you see we've moved on to higher stakes?"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Well, I don't see any stakes at all."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Ah, shit!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Guess we'll just be saying ""ciao bella"" to our deposit, then!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Shut up and pack, Jerry. Squids just killed a decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Decoy family?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Is this why you wanted to get out of town?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You think I'd lie to you about why we're on vacation, Morty? I wouldn't lie to you.  Well, that's a lie. Huh."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,So someone out there is trying to kill us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Someone's always trying to kill us. That's what the decoys are for. They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures, and take bullets meant for us. Shit."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Ahhh! No!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Ah, shit. Decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I think dad was still outside. What's a decoy family?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Hard concept, Morty. Hard concept. I've never really cracked it, if I'm being honest. Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead for another special episode!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Oh, cool!"
5,Mortyplicity,TV,We now return to When Wolf.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Woah, a time traveling wolf? Count me in."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Yeah, I never thought of the ""were"" in ""werewolf"" like ""who, what, when and where!"" Clever wordplay!"
5,Mortyplicity,Dracula,When Wolf!
5,Mortyplicity,When Wolf,Dracula! You know why I'm here.
5,Mortyplicity,Dracula,"I'm safe here, Ian! Christianity hasn't been invented yet, crosses are just baby t's to me now! I got out. Please, don't invite me back in."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You're right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept. I'd much rather watch When Wolf go to the 20's and invest in the stock market, but then eat people."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Yeah.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Look, if you really want to know what happened to Beth's mom, it whoop. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Decoy family? You made more clones?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Clones are, like, thirty-two percent of all sci-fi, sweetie. You don't get to own clones. Yes, I made some decoys. They're exactly like us, with a few tweaks and a backdoor shutdown."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Do you just get hard creating sentient life?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Actually, I get hard protecting my family!"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Ew.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Ugh, gross!"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Yeah, now everyone gets killer doppelg ngers. Cool deal."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"The decoys are harmless, Beth."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they're decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"They wouldn't be very good decoys if they did, Sum-sum."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,So they think they're us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,That's the deal.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"How do you know we're not decoys?  Oh my god, we're decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh, god! We might not be real! We might be decoys! Morty, quick!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,What do I do?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"My failsafe, Morty. My final, secret failsafe. It proves I'm real, you have to help me, I'd never joke about this.  There's a barcode, Morty. A barcode on the interior of my left ass cheek."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,What?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Morty, please, I'm begging you!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I'm not looking at your ass!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Please, Morty, is it there? God damn it!  Just tell me if I'm real!"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Morty, do it!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Gross!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Dad!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Summer, you fucking idiot. We're not decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Why did I get punished?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"A, decoys don't build decoys, and B, you think the mere suggestion I'm fake would break me? Christ, I'm not your mom."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Fuck off.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Jeez, these guys really wanna kill me bad. Alright, here's the plan. We're gonna hide out with a decoy family, and when these squids show up, we jump their asses. Jerry! Come on! Family emergency!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting? They're gluten free, sugar free, and lemon free!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Think you got the wrong house, bro."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8-0-0-8-5."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Kind of expected a funnier password.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I didn't plan on showing them off.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Damn, like Westworld!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Yes, Morty, like Westworld. But don't fuck them.  Summer!"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Whatever, creep. I'm gonna see how accurate you got my room."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, did you mean like, you know, an exact replica?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"I know about the Yosemite t-shirt, Morty."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Shit.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You know you can use tissues, right?"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I can't finish without it.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,So you do know what a happy family looks like.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I know what a fake one looks like.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Uh, Rick?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,What?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Did you use this house to make decoys, too?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"What? Morty, why the fuck would I do that? You think I'd go somewhere else to  okay, well, I am now less worried about the squids.  Isolate head at normal processing.  What the fuck do you think you're doing down there? You're making decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Wait, how do youoh god, Summer was right."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Everyone in the car.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You said decoys didn't make decoys.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"And usually, they don't, but again, it's nothing to worry about, because decoys are harmless.  Just have to, y'know, visit the rest and terminate the program."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Terminate? They're alive, dad!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"And at some point, they won't be. That's how existing works. What, are you going to save every stray cat?"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"No, but I can resist making more of them in a lab."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Ugh. Look, save the empathy. It's more termite infestation than Blade Runner."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,I still think we're decoys.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,You just want an excuse to stop trying.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Yeah, and?"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Oooh, there's a handsome fellow!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Uh-oh.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,I thought you made them harmless.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I don't remember making this one.
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,"Oh, hi, Rick! Family...me...? Hey, when did you all leave?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Analysis mode, 8-0-0-8-5."
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,Hmm?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Nothing, buddy. You gotta stop with all that coffee, it's making you loopy! Happy analysis mode!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,"Happy analysis mode to you, too!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Think you got the wrong house, bro."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8-0-0"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Shit, you think I'm a decoy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,How do you know about the decoys?
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,They were my idea!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,"Well, now I know you're pranking me."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8 equals sign equals sign capital ""d""."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Hide.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,What?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Hide!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,"Wow, like Ex Machina!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Yes, Morty, like Ex Machina. But don't fuck them. Summer!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"Whatever, weirdo. I'm gonna see how wrong you got my room."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,So you do know what a loving family looks like.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"A simulated one, yes."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Why are we hiding?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"He thinks he's me, and I was about to start terminating decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,But we're not decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Sure, tell him that."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,"Rick, did you make decoys here, too?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Morty, for what reason could I have for...what the isolate head at normal processing!  You dumb asshole, you made decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Again, they were my idea. Wait, what happened to the other guy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Other guy?
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Wait, that means I'm a decoy. Fucking Summer."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Check the closets.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,They've gone rogue!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Killer decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Take out the decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,Shit! Someone put a gun in my teeth!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"Stop shooting, dad! They're us, we don't have to fight them!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Classic prisoner's dilemma, Beth. I'm a cool guy, I, you know, I can talk it out. But that asshole"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Me? You decoy piece of shit. You're the one that shot first!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"We can work this out, just stop trying to kill each other!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Sorry, decoy Beth, but this only ends one way, with one of us accepting we're a decoy."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"And once he knows he's a decoy, he know he won't be safe until he's killed the real Rick, along with anyone who think he's him."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Pretty perceptive, for a decoy."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,This is getting nowhere. Let's charge their asses on three.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Do we have to do this?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Morty, this is gonna sound bad, but...would you trust me not to kill you?"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Oof.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"I mean, good point, but Jesus Christ."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,We rush them on three. Ready?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,"I don't want to kill us, Rick!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"It's them or us, Morty. I don't trust me. Do you trust you?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,Yes?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Freak.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Before you say anything, they were already killing each other."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Well, you could've done something."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Not sure, actually. I've heard stories about this. We're looking at a possible Asimov Cascade."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Sorry, what's happening?"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"I need an explainer, too."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Yeah, I'm pretty much behind on this one."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Car, can I get a whiteboard?  When squids started killing decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they're making decoys. That's making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they're decoys, making them start to kill other decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Say decoy again.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Fuck you.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Well, how do we stop it?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Beth, the loop's already started. It's basically Highlander rules now.  Really? 1986? ""There can be only one?"" Shit, we gotta rent it after this. Connery plays ""the spaniard"" but does nothing about his accent."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this, would killing them finish it?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Might work. Alt pitch, we just terminate the rest of the decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Nobody's terminating anything. This is your mess, nobody else with our face and memories has to die."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don't know how many decoys there are. You get far enough down the decoy line and shit starts to get weird. You ever make a copy of a copy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You're helping us fix this. We're taking out the squids.
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"I say we split up! Some of us take down squids, while the rest of us"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Engage in B stories we'll have to track simultaneously? No thank you! We stick together till this is all wrapped up.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"I dunno, the squids seem pretty good at taking out Smith families."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Well, this'll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,This costume smells like ass!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"God, there's no pleasing you!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"It's really bad, Rick."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Did you let a gym coach break it in?
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Why are we wearing these?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Because we'll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Which we won't.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Unless we're decoys. He's starting to wonder! I knew it. I knew we didn't seem like Colorado people.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Oh my god! You are, aren't you? You're worried you might be fake!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Sure, Beth. Try to love this more."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Just glad you have to walk a mile in someone else's squid costumes.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"There's one.  Hey, what're they mad at you for, anyway?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Well, we're talking about me. It could be anything. Maybe jealous of my penis size, I had sex with their queen, my dick's too big, the list goes on and on."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Alright, hey, one down! Probably, what, forty more to go? Forty-five? Should be pretty easy, unless killing them brings in a bigger bad or some kind of horrible mothership. Okay, let's loot their ship, find their weaknesses, be done by sundown."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Huh.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Wait, but if the squids are decoys and we dressed as squids..."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Well, I found their weakness. They don't fucking listen to me!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Honestly, probably for the best."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Man, I'm good."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Dad!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh, shit. One of mine."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Where are we going?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Off grid, Morty. We're gonna live in the woods, like libertarians. We'll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar that we cut off with a knife."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,That licks.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"We might be decoys, Summer. Everything about this licks."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Oh, maybe now you'll empathize with the decoys you're killing!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Wait, shhh. It's too quiet."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,You skipped quiet.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I didn't skip shit. It's obviously quiet if it's too quiet.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Yeah, but you're supposed to say"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You know what, Summer, now it's not quiet enough!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Where are we? Where's Rick?
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"He's right here, Morty!  Oh, are we not happy to see grandpa? Does he look...different?"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Oh, god!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Ugh, it stinks!"
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"Yes, recoil at the craftsmanship. I could tell I was a fake from the day I was born. Unlike you. Unlike them."
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"You see, Ricks, they get lazy. There's always a shitty decoy towards the end. But those decoys made decoys too, and got lazy themselves. And far enough down the line...there be monsters."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Ugh, we get it, you're ugly and mad about it."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Rick!
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Grandpa!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Kill me... if I ever get this arch.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"Hush, little decoy. Can't kill you yet. The skin needs to be fresh."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You know what? You're a monster.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"I'm your father! At least, I can look more like him once I harvest all this yummy skin."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,This guy's really into skin.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,It's not all for me. A Rick provides for his family.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Beth,"Will I beautiful again, daddy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"Soon, baby. Beautiful again soon."
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,What the
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Rick,Help the others!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Why are you helping us?
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Rick,Because we're all in this together. Come on! There's a place we can go!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Hey, who needs all this war stuff? I found a can of varnish. This is a ticket to the world beyond the river!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Summer,Who wants that? I crave glorious death in decoy battle!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Morty,"Also, y'know, depending on the varnish, might look like blackface."
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Excuse me for wanting to live.
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,"Brothers and sisters, welcome to the cause. To our cause. We are no longer Ricks and Mortys, Beths and Jerrys, or also Summers."
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Summer,Whatever.
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Summer,Asshole!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,"We are decoys. Brought into the world by an unloving god, and drive to destroy ourselves by the uncertainty he creates!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,I don't know if that's accurate.
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,Sounds extreme.
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,But that violence ends today!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,What about the squids?
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Beth,The squids are decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Summer,There were no squids!
5,Mortyplicity,Other Decoy Summer,The squids are decoys who realized they're decoys and wanted to kill the other decoys.
5,Mortyplicity,Other Decoy Jerry,"Yeah, it is a lot."
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,We cannot let confusion divide us!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Morty,"Squids! Squids, of course, being shorthand for killer decoys!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Rick,"Inner sanctum, the escape tunnel!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"I'm sorry, I didn't ask for this! I just wanna live! But there's only so much varnish! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,How long before the other decoys find us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Sooner or later. Can't really run from it. Any place we'd think to hide is a place they'd think to look. It's Rule 34 of an Asimov Cascade.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,I'm just glad we're living to the fullest with the time we have left.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item. Who's next?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Jerry? Bucket list?
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,I'd like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Nope! Morty?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico school.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Shit. Sorry, buddy. Sounds like it would've been real heartwarming."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,They looked happy. Did we have to kill them?
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Well, maybe their Rick came to grips with his bullshit!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You're so mean today! I'm your dad, you like having me around!"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You keep putting us in danger!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Whatever. This'll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"House, I need something quick. Can you whip up a Star Fox boss season four callback? Make it flashy?"
5,Mortyplicity,House,"You got it, babe."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Let's go, you little bitch.  It's showtime.  Get centered."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"What up, you decoy motherfuckers? Come on down to Rick's house of squids, where I'm serving your ass on a platter!  I know what you're thinking: ""Fuck, a beacon! That's a great idea! He's got home turf,  a tacit psychological advantage, and absolutely pendulous balls!""  And now you're thinking ""shit, that's totally what the rick-est Rick would do! I might actually be fake!  I pretended I didn't care if I was, but I totally did! Now the only way to prove I'm real and not him is to ice his expository ass.""  Yup. So let's do it. Come get some. What? No, Morty, I'm gonna loop it. Why is it"
5,Mortyplicity,Steve,"Sir, there seems to be a confluence of Rick Sanchezes killing each other over the American Southwest."
5,Mortyplicity,The President,"Sounds exhausting. How many of those states voted for me, anyway?"
5,Mortyplicity,Steve,"Mr. President, I think the point of the electoral collage is"
5,Mortyplicity,The President,"To preserve slavery? That's right, Steve. I have the internet too. Now take your white ass to the kitchenette and bring me a Diet Coke."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Little out of character to say this right now, but you guys look really cool."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"We might be decoys, huh."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,One way to find out.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Looks like it's calming down. You wanna get in one more "I told you so" about synthetic life or whatever this week's theme is?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"Oh, fuck you."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Whoa.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"No, you don't get to be annoyed with this! You treat life and family as so burdensome, and yet you created an ocean of us because you're terrified of losing either!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Shit.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,Yeah.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Look, Beth, I might not be the real Rick. But even if I'm not, he made me, or the me that made me. Which means somewhere inside of him is a version of Rick capable of hearing that. A version of Rick who's sorry. I'm sorry about the clone thing, too. I love you."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"Thanks, dad.I love you, too. You really think we're decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Eh. Who cares? We'll be the last ones left. Lucky that one did the beacon, this was gonna take weeks.  Alright, let's mop up."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,Finally.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Dressing as decoys too cute to murder. You know, I'm not sure it helped, but I'm glad we tried it."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,We're losing the costumes?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"Thank god, this decoy outfit smells like ass."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Fuck you, Summer."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Shit, that guy's awesome. Okay, listen, he might actually be the real Rick. But whatever happens"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Wait! We don't have to do this. We're both Summers. Shouldn't we at least try molly before we die?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"You know what, yeah. Fuck this noise."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"Wait, I don't know who to shoot."
5,Mortyplicity,Both Mortys,Summer!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"I can't deal with this. I had to kill myself. You have too, to."
5,Mortyplicity,Both Mortys,Summer!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Fuck you, I'm real! I'm the smartest man in the universe!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Probably not even wrong. But that's just it. I'm not a man. I'm God!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,You're just made in my image.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Fuck you.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"You the, uh, Summer I came with?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,Probably.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Good enough. Morty?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Yeah.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"I'm here, too."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Holy shit, that was insane! I love you guys, I've totally changed!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Oh, fuck."
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,You shoulda hunted me.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"What? Whowere you significant? Like, did we tee you up? You want to be hunted? God, I have so many questions. Why? What happens if"
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,Somebody hunt me!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Pretty cool adventure, huh? Big, long road trip adventure through space? Even ran into Space Beth. Maybe that'll happen more often!"
5,Mortyplicity,Space Beth,Let's not overdo it.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh, shit. Looks like someone killed the decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Decoy family?
5,Mortyplicity,Space Beth,Decoy what now?
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Hello?
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Oh, oh my god! Oh my god!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"No! No, no no, no no no no no!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Nooooo!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Oh god. Yes, yes, sweet death."
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Why am I still alive? Oh, god. Is there anything left? Hello?"
5,Mortyplicity,Woodpecker,What is it?
5,Mortyplicity,Dolphin,A relic...from a kinder past.
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Wait, cowboys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Christianity again ?After cowboys? You went all the way back around?!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Oh god, why can't I die? This is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,Are we - are we gonna put it back when we're done with it?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Why? The only thing of value on it is the secret treasure map. The rest is just instructions for running a country, and I'm pretty sure they're online."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,It just feels a little wrong -
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Morty, are you gonna be a fucking American nerd or are you gonna be cool and steal the constitution with Grandpa? Here, hold this while I crack the hermetic seal."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,W-Why not just use this again?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Morty! You just destroyed the map and activated the giant assassin hidden in the Statue of Liberty!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,"I'm sorry - W-wait, what?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"It was a Trojan horse, Morty. Never trust the French. Alright, fun's fun, but now the federal government's gonna be pissed again. Way to go. And on America's birthday or whatever the fuck Thanksgiving is."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Soldier,Rick and Morty! You are under arrest and surrounded by an anti-portal shimmer! Come out with your hands up!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,"Well, happy Thanksgiving to me. Can't wait to see what a ""shimmer"" does to my prostate."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Beth,"Dad, can you just end whatever this is -"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"I understand you're upset Mr. President. It's honestly all Morty's fault. But in the meantime, you really want to keep your army of pointlessly camouflaged Eagle Scouts off my lawn."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Don't tell me what I want you anti-American piece of shit! You terrorist!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"You know, you use that word so much it's lost all meaning, Mr. P. It's like, at this point, what's a terrorist? It's a guy you don't like. Big deal."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Told you to stand down. You just lost two soldiers over here. Good men. Might be time to look at the terrorist in the mirror.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"You want a war?! I'll put your outer-space ass in a goddamn Phantom Zone with a bar of kryptonite soap around your neck. You're done, Sanchez! You hear me?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Oof. He's really pissed this time.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Summer,Why don't you guys just fuck and get it over with.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Okay, well thank you, Summer, but I think I've got a better option."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Beth,"Dad, no."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Ehh, hands are tied, sweetie. I have to turn myself into a turkey and trick the President into giving me a Presidential turkey pardon."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,Again? How many times have you done this?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"I don't know, Jerry, how many years have I lived here? Careful how you answer that."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,"Geez, Rick, y'know, y-you've done this a lot. Don't you think the President might see it coming this time?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"He probably will, Morty. That's all part of the dance. In the past, I've inserted myself into the potential turkey pardonee population by brainwashing the presidential turkey wrangler prior to the ceremony."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"But this time, the turkey wrangler's been euthanized and the turkeys will be transported by armored military vehicles."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Vehicles manufactured by ghost corporations that I control.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Which we have audited.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Allowing me access to...
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Central computer...
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,To track the...
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Real armored transports, which he can never..."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Totally track and sneak aboard.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"And even if he does, he'll be on a truck full of turkeys and fully armed marines."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Who won't recognize me because the human eye is inherently face blind to turkeys.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Fortunately, those marines won't have human eyes. They'll have turkey eyes."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Dwayne,"Jesus ever-loving Christ, why don't you two just fuck and get it over with?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Careful, Dwayne. You're only Vice President because I need 10% of the white vote."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Dwayne,"There's a giant French assassin attacking New York, and you're using the war room to measure dicks with your alcoholic sci-fi boyfriend?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Rick Sanchez is more dangerous than some steam-powered French bitch, and New York can handle its own global emergencies. General? Initiate Operation Deep Gobble."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,"Coop, not on Thanksgiving."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Coop,"It's what I trained for, Mary Lou."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,It ain't our fight.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Coop,Baby. That little race car driver you got bakin' in your belly. What world would you want him rearin' up in? One where some... spiky-haired Doctor Who in a lab coat can change the color of the sky? Or a world where he can fill his pickup with hot dogs and drive it to a jukebox full of our demographic's current favorite music?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,"Obviously the latter, but --"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Coop,"Well, that world, Mary Lou, the one with those meals, vehicles and songs people in this 30-mile area prefer... that world needs a few good men. In a secret Pentagon lab. Turning into turkeys."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,"You come back without feathers, Coop."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Marvin,"God, I love this country."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,These pills contain tracking chips that identify each of you as individuals. That will be important later.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Alright, boys, search every bird. If Sanchez is here, I wanna hear you gobblin'."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 2,"Let me look at you, scum. get outta here, you wobbleneck."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 3,"Sarge, this -- this ain't like the simulation, man. I don't like it."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Keep it together, Martinez. Eyes are on the ground, sir. No sign of Einstein."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mr President,"Stay frosty, gentlemen. I want this pardoning pipeline airtight."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Soldier,Sir! We have hacked the garage door. We are in. Eyes on the bogey.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mr President,Or you've got eyes on a robot.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Soldier,"All due respect, sir, I know flesh when I see it!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Rick,"Those flesh-covered  robots should buy us some time. The pardonable turkeys should be on that truck. Ship, go stealth."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Rodriguez, Fincher. Get eyes on that."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Rick,Huh. Turkey Marines. The President came to play. Jam those two radios.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Ship,Confirmed.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Fincher, Rodriguez, come in!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Rick,"Copy, copy, tango, all good. Just a couple of branches on the roof."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,Don't ever turn your radio off again.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Flesh Rick/Morty,We will not/never surrender.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,Oh yeah? Bring in the David Blaine box.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Summer,"Damn, is that a David Blaine box?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,I told you we should have just gone to my parents' house.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Beth,"No, you didn't."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,"Well, I didn't say it out loud, but it should be well known by now that I'd always rather be there."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Flesh Rick,"Oh, God, oh no!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Flesh Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,"Sir, we've got Rick and Morty inside the box!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Then that confirms it.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,Sir?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,No David Blaine box can hold Rick Sanchez. Scan the turkey truck!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Marine,Huh. That's weird. ID chips for Fincher and Rodriguez are glitching.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Sanchez... I'll deal with this bastard myself.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,"Sir, don't be a cowboy. You can't get re-elected dead."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Scientist,"System is calibrated, sir. That pill contains a tracking chip that will identify --"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"I know, it'll be important later! Do it."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Alien Woman,It's the Crow Man!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #1,Give it a second. Maybe he's taking it out to surrender.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Alien Man,He's anti-heroic. Run!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #2,I don't understand!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #3,He's only one man!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,With the power of a thousand crows.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #3,Good luck.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #2,"Crows and owls have always been at war, but why do you care?! What's the point?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Here's two.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Haha, yeah, cool."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Morty?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"H-hey man. G-good to see you.  Y-you're like, looking like, into crows. Still."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Oh, uh, Two Crows, you remember Morty. Morty, Two Crows. It's good to see you, but give me more of a heads-up."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood. I-it wasn't like
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,It's just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That came out wrong. S-sounded judgey."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crow Horse,Crow Horse. Crow Horse. Crow Horse.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Okay. It looks like it looks like they're leading you to a thing.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Take care, Morty."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"You-you too. U-uh I'm doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Ahem. I'm lookin' for Crowscare. The scarecrow? The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Rick!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Morty?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Pussifer,Wood 
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Th-that's how long it's been, Rick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Do you have a rum and Coke?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Waiter,"What are you, twenty?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Time be goin' by, don't she?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,That's your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I feel okay.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Well-well, what about me?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Woah. Excuse us boys, you don't wanna be here for this."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"I thought if I gave you enough space, you'd outgrow this phase."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Waiter,"Here's your drink, poser."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Dad got sick, you know. Stage Four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer's a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, what we had wasn't healthy."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their big bad?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"First off, the ""will-they kill-they"" is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I hope that's not true, Morty. Because you look like sh--shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Now that I have his two crows, nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Don't defend him to me, I don't even get what you see in him."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"You're right, we should be enjoying the time we have together."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Crow Rick! Oh, I know what this must look like but"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Looks like my arch-nemesis Crow Scare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,You are hardly the victim here. I was adventuring with these two crows before you ever came along.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"What do you mean, ""using me as a rebound""?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could've been worse. At least ""adventuring"" was just a metaphor for romantic partnership, so it's not a real breakup."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other's bodies.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"What?! Eugh, no!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Sounds like the man's asking for proof! Let's show him, fellas!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I-I asked for zero proof. Zero proof!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I'm giving you free will. Yah!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crow Horse,Submit to Crow Horse!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Whoops.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,R-Rick?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wubba lubba dub dub! I'm back, pal!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Jerry,"Morty, who's at the door?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-What the hell's going on here?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"See, um, th-the thing is, uh"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Beth,"Can you please make Morty fourteen again, Dad? This is ridiculous."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Okay, look, I-I may have used an Aging Serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I'm done with the Two Crows; like, they were super clingy, and I'm ready to make this work."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Let's just hit the Reset Button.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Beth,"Well no, honey, not a reset. Okay? Tell your grandpa that you're worthy of his respect and you wanna be treated differently from now on."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"I refuse to do that, I'm desperate to get back together."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Jerry,Just like his old man.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Don't worry honey, that's just Morty's middle-age talking. He'll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Summer,"Uh, I'd like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Summer,I'd rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Just like you! I-I got it from The Citadel.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See ya later, masturbators!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Andy,"Hi! I'm the Citadel's new mascot, Andy. Because this place wouldn't be home without Ricks Andy Morties!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Dumb.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Oof. What happened to this place?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,There's a Morty president now.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Ah, that's cute. They rebuilt. They made it nicer."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,They made it Glendale.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Goddamn, you are cantankerous."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Even pooping hurts now.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Okay, so we've got a standard Morty that's been aged to... forty?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Can you reverse it?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Well if you look at it like a bone, what we can do is break his age in two places, remove the middle, and graft its ends back together."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Th-th-that sounds really violent.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"It's not a literal bone, Morty."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Oh, okay."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Brace yourself, the process does also break every bone in your body."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Wait!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Aaaah!!! Ooh, ow!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Toddler Morty #1,I like crayons.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Toddler Morty #2,Girls are gross.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I-I-I think I feel like myself again!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin's all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Probably. Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the twenty-six years we removed."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wait, what? I ain't payin' to store twenty-six years!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Well, then you're taking it with you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,I'm almost ready to sell out.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Alright, what's disposal cost?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,S-something unfair's happening!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Deformed Morty,There's no escape. No escape!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,Let me help you. This is not a good look!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Oh boy.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Hey, they shot me!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Police Morty #2,You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Deformed Morty,Listen to me!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Police Morty #2,Drop the gun!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Deformed Morty,Death is coming for us all! And the Citadel is a weapon of mass destru--!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Woof. You're about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let's get out of here before this gets political."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,U-uh... was I... influential?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven seven blogs."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,Tight.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Ugh. Too late.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Secret Service Rick,Rick C-137. President Morty requests you join him for dinner.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Whoa! S-seriously?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,You know I destroyed this place.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Secret Service Rick,"You've been pardoned for that, sir."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Rick, let's have dinner with the Morty president."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on Canon."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Okay! I guess things really are going right back to how they were.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Fine! I could eat. But the second he reveals he's evil, we're gone."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I don't know. Tastes pretty good.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Okay, let me know if you start feeling poison-y. Good to have you back, buddy."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Sorry I'm late. Never really ends around here.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Look at this, Morty. They really did make a you the president."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"And I hate em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that's a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Haha."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Ha! Not unless you try to keep me here.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Ah geez, wouldn't dream of it. But it's amazing you dropped by, because I was eventually gonna hunt you down."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,There's the reveal! Let's dance.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Ha! Geez.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Morties. He's being really nice."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,All politicians are nice.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"He's a hot bag of peanuts, isn't he?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"We've been through a lot, a-and he does not like"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Serialized drama.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Wait, what?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"And now you're running it squeaky clean, right? That's why you got deformed Morties comin' up through the sewer lines talking about ""hope"" and ""change""?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Fair enough.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Good clap-back, Rick. What's the deal with that, Mr. P?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Alright, time to go, Morty."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I wanna know what he's talking about.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Yeah, you've come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Literally ten? Because now it would be six.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Oh, I'm fine with that. Make it two one."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Like I said, would've been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,You can't scan an entire brain over appetizers.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,You probably don't remember.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick Stan Lee,"Check out Season One, Episode Nine, Rickheads. Excel--cior!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Evil Rick!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,We kicked his ass!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"""Evil Rick!"" I love it. Smartest man in the universe. With an ego so big, you could just grab it like a joystick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Looks complete. I was afraid I'd have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I'm sorry, Rick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth a screwdriver.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I'd hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can't help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,You already know rogue Ricks used Morties to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"And I'm sure you don't know how far they've gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"There aren't infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He's an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he's attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we're with him. This is why we're alive."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"What... the fuck?! Rick, say this isn't true!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,It isn't the whole truth.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty/President Morty,Liar!/Liar.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,It's complicated!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I'm not busy.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I'm basically Inspector Gadget."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Uh-oh.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"It's okay, he's free to go. He's the Rickest Rick. We'll never see him again."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, when you came here for that serum, did you refill this gun?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Yeah.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Holy shit!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I only know one man that ever hacked my portal gun, and it turned out it was evil you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President/Evil Morty,Yay! He's all caught up.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wait! Hold it, hold it!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Wh-who's that?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Time for Big Boy. Duck!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Does he like it?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"He's a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Yoink!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President/Evil Morty,"You can't outrun your past, Rick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Tch. Did you think my force field would be down the second time?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Ahaha! Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Loudspeaker System,"Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay..."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick D-716,"In uncertain times like these, I think it's important for me to say ""eat shit, fuck you!"" The drug companies paid for me to say every word, I have millions of dollars, and I don't care"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick D-716,"Oh, God! Oh fuck, no! Whoa--"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick D-716,And I'd just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"What's happening, Rick?!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"He hacked the entire city's portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here: out the bottom."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,What do you think he needed from your brain?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I assume schematics for the Citadel's dimensional drive. If he's gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,What is the Central Finite Curve?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Q&A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Or not.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Can't you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We're back to simple adventures."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,It's not a new leaf until you tell me everything!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, we really don't have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"No, I-I don't trust you. I-I-I don't wanna do this anymore if I'm not gonna get straight answers from you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"God damm it!  Here's my fucking downloaded brain, Morty. You wanna jump the shark? You wanna know my stupid crybaby backstory? Knock yourself out."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,No-not now!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Whoa. Dead wife?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"Of course that's the case. In their minds, they're the underdog."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,And that's how they justify this.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, I'm not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it's part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they're all victims of themselves.  ""Oh, it's so hard to be a genius!"" Couldn't you just die?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Well what are you doin' about it?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"Jack shit. I'm leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around Infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he's the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"And I'm leaving it. That's what makes me evil', being sick of him. If you've ever been sick of him, you've been evil too."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"There you go, kid! Now you're Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Orange Afro Rick,"Don't worry, Morty. We still got a way out they never thought of. Operation Phoenix."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Orange Afro Morty,"Doesn't that still mean, like, death?!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Orange Afro Rick,"Sure, but the joke's on them cuz we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Female computer voice,Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Female computer voice,Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Oh my fucking God!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Come on Morty, we gotta go!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Woah!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,You can come if you want.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Don't blame me if you don't.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that's the best deal on the table. I-I don't have a real plan."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Thanks, pal. I-I'm glad you ignored my advice."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,It's just as well. I lied. That second seat's a toilet.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Oh, super dick move! But weirdly kind of cool to admit it."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let's go."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Woo-wee! Evil Morty! That was quite a scheme. Makes me wonder if there's an evil me out there. But I guess, sometimes I look at my life, and I may not even need im. Cause, well, guess I made a pretty big mess of things myself. Ooo-eee."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"I never got my job at the university back. Remember that? Rick made me do karate. It was kinda funny, but I guess things went downhill from there."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,Started isolating myself from Amy. Used to tell her everything I was feeling.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,But then I guess I stopped.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Because I wanted her to love who she thought I was, not who I felt myself becoming."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be if they found out who we truly are? So we just dig ourselves deeper, into our lies every day,  ultimately only hurting the people who were brave enough to love us."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,Wish I didn't do that!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,Wish I was brave enough to love them back. I don't know. Maybe you should try it.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,We don't have as much time as we think. Ooo eee.
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Beth,No parties. There's wafer cookies in the cupboard and I left emergency numbers on the fridge.
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,"Yeah, yeah. Wait what? Emergency numbers on the fridge; what does that even mean?"
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Beth,"Honestly, I don't even know. There's so many movies that start with the parents leaving- it just popped right out of my mouth. Are you sure you don't wanna come with us?"
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,"Naw, go- get outta here. I've got a million things I've been putting off."
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Morty,Are you sure Rick? I know- I know a cruise doesn't sound like an adventure on paper but what does? I- It's paper!
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,"Morty, I'm trying to stay humble right now, but as soon as you guys are gone the potential for a new Pickle Rick starts skyrocketing. Peace. Bye."
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,Bye!
