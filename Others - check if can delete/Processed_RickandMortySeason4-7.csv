4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,Did you get the Ultimate Cube?
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Oh, it's purple."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,You said it was purple.
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"I said mine was, I didn't know they all were."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"And now we do, thanks to Chichi."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,Chachi!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,"So, uh...w-w-when do I get it?"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Get what, a hug? Let's find a planet with a garden hose first?"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,A dragon!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,A dragon?
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,"You asked me to cut class and fight robots with, I said no, you said millions of lives depend on it, I said I'll do it for a dragon, you said whatever, I want my dragon!"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds that refuse to admit they're Christian."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,I want my dragon!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,"Let me get you rocket shoes, l-let me get you Wolverine claws, let me get you a fucking rocket hat! Just make sure to use it with rocket shoes or it'll rip your head off."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Morty,"I want my dragon, I want my dragon, I want my dragon¡®!"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,Oh crap. {coughs} Crap!
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Beth,"Dad, are you okay? Your ship crashed in Malta."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,{grunts} I'm okay.
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Beth,"Oh, thank god."
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Beth,"Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon?"
4,Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty,Rick,AAAAAAARGH!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,Morty's on Jessica's Instagram again.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Get out of here, jerk!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,"What's so embarrassing, Morty? Sharing it with your family might help."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,"Summer, stop shaming your brother.  Morty, stop being a creepy, perverted cyberstalker."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,I'm not cyberstalking! I-I-I just wanted to know where she got this necklace from.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Hi. I've placed an auto-response chip in my brain so I can spend time with my family.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,But you are spending time with your family.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Uh...
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,Dad? There's a way we do this now.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Morty, would you please accompany me to Forbodulon Prime for death crystals?"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Well, thank you for asking. Yes, I will do that."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,It is a hot photo.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"You're thinking of bullets, Morty. Death crystals show you how you're gonna die."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Jesus Christ! I-I die a million times?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Your future stems from your  present, which, if you're living right, keeps changing. Truth is, anyone that knows how they're definitely gonna die is either boring as hell or about to get shit."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Crystal poachers.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,I will avenge my death.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Holy shit!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Just kidding. I'm a crisis detection and correction hologram generated by a chip that ""real"" Rick put in your spine. ""Real"" in quotes because calling density-privileged entities ""real"" is incredibly holo-phobic. Morty, do me a solid... problematic wordplay aside... grab the gun with the blue handle from the trunk and get a tissue sample from the corpse."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Alright, now take that to the trunk and insert it into the clone compiler. I see you appear to be holding a death crystal that's guiding your decisions more than I am. That's your right. I just want to remind you that some people can't hold anything and can never die, so that's a little offensive to..."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Then we'll get along fine, Fascist Morty."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Fascist Morty,You will go where I want you to go!!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go! Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Alright. Okay, regroup, everybody. You, too, Berkeley!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Here's an idea, Morty. Throw that thing in the garbage, stop planning your own death, and talk to whoever you want."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"You're better than that language, Morty."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"I ain't better than shit, Jack."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"No, it looks like this. It's, like, identical to this, actually."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Goddamnit! When did this shit become the default?!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Apparently, it doesn't matter."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Just doin' what I gotta do.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,Excuse me? This chicken is quite real to me.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,Nutrients?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,What's the last thing you ate?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Baloney and an orange.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo Rick,"Alright, Morty, a deal's a deal. Once we bring your Rick back to life, then I'll help you with the bully."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,"Sorry, Hologram Rick. I'm going with the crystal on this one."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Nope.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,COP,We've got an Akira-type situation going on behind the mall. Over.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,Shield me from the law!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Wasp-Rick,"Damn, your Morty sucks."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Holo-Rick,"Aah, wasps!"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Why the hell didn't you show Morty how to bring my body back to life?
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Shh, quiet, idiot. Quiet. It's gonna be alright. You don't get to know how you're gonna die."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,I-I thought you were proud to be a hologram!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"There's a lesson here, and I'm not the one that's gonna figure it out."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Oh, boy, so, you actually learned something today? What is this, ""Full House""? I was living in the moment all day, and it kept getting me kill by nazi. I Ithink you have to think ahead and live in the moment."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,"Oh, real nice, Rick.Turning our son into an Akira? Real nice."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Eat my ass, Jerry. He turned himself into Akira."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,"Oh, I'll eat it, because this is my house, Rick. I'll eat any ass I want."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,Gross.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Morty,I'm fine. Get off Rick's back. Rick wasn't even here when I was doing all that stuff. That was all on me.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,That finger has AIDs now. Not my fault.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Beth,"He's messing with you, sweetie."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Jerry,But it's tingling!
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,...cumfest and...
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"Wait, wait, what the fuck?"
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,Nothing. I didn't say anything. I was just playing along with you guys.
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Rick,"You know I record everything, right? Garage, isolate Summer's voice and play back."
4,Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,Summer,"Oh, and then you guys can get married, and, like, suck each other off in a testosterone-addled fucking third-grade-boy cumfest and..."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Tickets Please Guy,"Tickets, please."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,Barkeep. A drink for my colleague.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"I know the only reason to travel by train is to travel with weapons. And we all know that at the end of this line, There's only one creature worth killing. The man in the white coat. May as well take turns exchanging stories. Mine begins on planet Ramamama."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"Lower him into acid. Once he's dissolved, lower someone else into acid. Is he dissolved? At least use the downtime to reset the acid lowerer. I really don't like the attitude around here. It's a very ""lower me into acid"" attitude."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,Who are you?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,How did you reach my sanctum?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"All right, this is going in circles. Seize him!"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,Very well. Now I will fight you.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"Anyway, he tells a different version of the story Where I start crying or something. That's why he has to die. 'Cause he's a liar. So... Why are you going to kill Rick Sanchez?"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Ramamama Leader,"If you're trying to be hurtful, you're doing a good job."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Clam Alien,I'll take his turn. Here's why I'm going to kill Rick Sanchez.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Clam Alien,Dissolve to a clam-shaped sun Rising over a giant beach.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Candy Santa Alien,"By then, of course, he had left toys And flesh drops for every one of us in the spore-hive. Ah, a newcomer! I suppose you think you have a better story about how Rick Sanchez saved space Christmas."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Goomby,I think the best way to answer that is with my Christmas Rick tale.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Goomby,Tell your Christmas Rick story!
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,Uh-huh...
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Morty? I told you if you found me again, identify yourself."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,I didn't know it was you. How did you not recognize me? Didn't you create the disguises?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"When I create shit, it works, Morty. It's called being talented."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,Why can't we find the engine?
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"It's not a real train, it's a story device. Literally. A literal literary device Quite literally metaphorically containing us."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,A simulation.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Worse. An anthology. Okay, so how... H-How do we hijack it?"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Oh, Morty, it's been hijacked for at least two full minutes. Are you not hearing this insane conversation? Okay, tickets please guy, stop the anthology. If we wanted one-offs, we'd do interdimensional cable, Not some uptight, overwritten... Rick? God damn!"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,"Dude, I'm sure you've got, like, So many tickets at this point. Jesus! The tickets please guy is cut! He... he... he's... he's got those things. W-What do you call them. Uhm, cum gutters."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Morty, gross!"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,That's what people call them.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Gross people. I don't want to have to picture cum so watery in such volumes that... Hey, hey, hey, stay back. I'll kick you. I-I'll kick your shin, bro. Aaah! Hey! I'll fucking cook and eat your ticket-taking ass!  Hey, I found a ticket.  Wow, you are just... Ladies and gentlemen, The Jackie chan of human shielding. Who takes the time to get this good at... Fuck this. Aaah... Structural breach. Losing continuity. Morty, hold on to something. Keep your head inside."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Female voice,Emergency continuity deployed.
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,"He is Rick! Jesus Christ! Is that the tickets please guy? Well, just the stub. Too soon! Too soon! Don't move! Too soon! So, what did the train cops do wrong? Shot... People? Hot passengers. Wrong. The passengers tampered with the anthology's structure. Lethal response was permitted, But not with him holding that tank. Let's take a look at what they should have done. Train cops! Hands in the air! Drop the tank! Drop it! Drop it! Drop the tank.  Sorry to nitpick, sir, but if there was A continuity explosion, isn't there always one? And doesn't that mean those two could be anywhere? What? No, you idiot, that... it's... it's just a training video. That didn't actually happen. That's what you think. Hey. How'd you get here? Yeah, like we're the ones that popped up out of nowhere? Fuck these guys.  Hey, what the hell? Your leg is healed. Yeah, it's a real free-for-all. Here we go. Of course this thing is just a fucking circle. You'd think it was so God damn complicated... Okay, here's where the stupid vignettes were. God, imagine if that had been the whole thing. So now we're here, and the engine must be here. I'll have to rig us a couple of space suits that start failing around here so we can  pay a heavy price for re-entering at this threshold. We have to leave the train? We don't have to do anything, Morty. This is just a structural guide. We're obviously gonna impart our own style. I don't like how meta this is getting, Rick. Shut up, Morty. You're 14. You watch videos of people on YouTube Reacting to fucking YouTube. I'll be the judge of when we get too meta. Holy shit. How is he still breathing? Aah! He's suspended in disbelief, Slowly dying while living out an alternative Non-diagetic reality. Geez, what a horrible way to die. You don't know the half of it. Oh!  You're on fuego with the guy-torn-in-half bits, Rick. That one was organic, though. That's because you're naturally funny. That... that's good old-fashioned fun Right there, you know? W-w-we don't need to over-think shit, okay? Okay, buddy. Nice and grounded, Fully immersive from here on out.  Right after this. W-What's happening? Going into an act break.  ? Not quite a bird  ?  ? Not quite a person  ?  ? Maybe what matters  ?  ? Is to love yourself first and  ?  ? Soar  ?  ? Child of air and land  ?  ? With wings and hands  ?  ? Yes, you're a bird and a person  ?  ? I'm a bird and a person  ?  ? And more  ? Sure, that was a great moment, But it was hardly the best time Rick and Morty were musical. Who can forget the t... Hey. You guys think there's something weird about this train? We've been here a really long time And nobody's taken our tickets. Aaah!  Aaaah! The galaxy's greatest scientists continue to ponder The horrific figure known to children as floaty blood man. But after three months, nobody is any closer to the truth. For cutesy name news, I'm uncle nibbles. I can't believe floaty bloody man is real. He's more than real, he's my new God. Check it. Is that brand-new, Or is the blood just... Accurately depicted, yeah. His followers believe the entire universe is floaty bloody man's nightmare as he dies in a time-dilated reality. So we could go at any minute. No. I'm part of the floaty nogasm brotherhood. We believe we're keeping him alive By redirecting our suppressed sexual energies. You're staying a virgin Just to keep the universe existing? That's... So attractive. It is? Okay, look, let's just do it once.  Sorry. Aaah! Happy now? He was suffering. Keep moving. We have to get to the return threshold Before the ticking clock on your suit gets to zero. Why would you put ticking clock... Because if it's too easy to get there, We'll never get there. If you don't want to be meta stop, deconstructing shit. That's the thematic seal. Gotta find a way to disrupt it. Okay, Morty, tell a story unrelated to us."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Morty,"Uh, what do..."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Okay, just stop."
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Relax, your story was supposed to be awful and stupid. I just failed to predict how well that would mesh with the theme. Think. Think. What kind of story would we never... Morty, do you know what the bechdel test is?"
4,Never Ricking Morty,Rick,"Story lord. I should've known you were behind this, and I did."
4,Never Ricking Morty,"Who is this guy? Ugh. He's like a matrix space frasier. Let's get this fight over with, nerd. I've got shit to do. You of all people know, Rick, There can be no destination without a journey. I don't know that at all. I regularly teleport. Oh, of course. No rules for you. Spiraling through the multiverse, Burping semi-improvised dialogue about how nothing matters, So we may as well pull out our dicks and rub them On fate's glaring teeth like we're brushing fate's teeth But we're using your gross, dirty dick. Must be nice.  Nobody's stopping you. True. Not anymore.  Goddamn! We already did this. Oh, is this a double beat? Oh, well. Just how I adventure, dawg. This is more impressive than the tickets please guy, though. You are like 90% cum gutter. It's called discipline. Watch this. God damn. Geez! Do we have to fight him? I don't want to. We surrender. We're not fighting.  Ow! Ow! Fucking kick your ass. Ow! Oh!  Hey! Get back in your egg! What the... Don't worry, Morty! Nothing out there is canon!  We've got a pulse. Stay with me, private. Smith, listen to me. You were exposed to a chemical that is altering your mind. To beat it, you have to hold on... We're losing him. Aliens. Sarge?! Morty, never forget the highest truth of all... You're getting your ass kicked on a train.  Professor Sanchez? Did it work? I wouldn't say that, Marcus. I'd say it fucking worked. 100% time dilation and total immersion. Define ""total."" Marcus, I've been back in reality for three hours, and I still have memories of a completely different life. I-I-I was a scientist still. I-I-I was... I-I-I had developed Inter-dimensional travel, I-I-I-I had a daughter. I-I didn't have a mustache. I-I was kinda funny sometimes, mostly burping. No more secret testing. I can help people now. You've helped people. I've hurt more. Aaah! P-p-professor Sanchez. I-I'm Morty Smith From the... the... The the 241st. They... they... put your pill in our food. It... it works. Call the police! It's okay. It's okay. It's not real. N-n-n-n-nothing's real. I'm sorry, son. I-I-it's okay. You aren't real.  God, you're right. I should do more freeform stuff. In you go. What's happening? The reason I brought you here. I'll now fuel my anthology with your limitless potential, propelling it to its final stop... beyond the fifth wall. You idiot. Our potential isn't limitless. You'll never break the fifth wall Before you've burnt us out. Is that so? Oh, well. Win-win. Rick, w-what's he doing? He's trying to tap into us, Morty. Resist. I can't believe you're finally headed off to college. Yeah, you know, it really felt like you were gonna be 17 forever. For, like, 16 years, at least. I can't believe I'm tearing up over this. Jesus, Rick, you know, you've really softened up. It's a human moment, Morty. It's a human moment. Aaah! Aaah! It hurts!  Abradolph lincoler? I thought you were dead. I'm very much alive, and I need your help. Yeah! Shit, he's taking the good stuff, Morty. Wait, is... is any of this canon? It could have been.  Oh, dear. Are there things Rick Sanchez holds sacred after all?    How did you find us?  I trusted you! Don't blame others for your bad decisions.  Resist, Morty! Resist before he burns us out! Oh, too late now! What's wrong, Rick? Don't you want to see how your story ends?!   ?  ?  Holy shit, Rick. What do we... There... there... There's now way out! You're right, Morty. Sometimes it does seem like there's no way out. Like it's hopeless. But remember, there's always someone there for us. Who? My best friend and personal savior, Jesus Christ. What?! You... you don't believe in God. But he believes in us, Morty. You know, I thought I was the inventor, but the greatest invention of all is the free gift of eternal life. Is this... Are you fucking with me?  Oh, trust me, Morty. I've done plenty of effed up stuff in my life. But it's never too late to accept Christ. Jesus is always knocking at the door. All we have to do is open it and let him into our hearts. How? I'm so glad you asked, Morty. Just close your eyes and go to him in prayer. Like this. Heavenly father. Heavenly father. Together","Thank you for sending your only begotten son. What a second, no! What are you doing?! Jesus, I accept you into my heart. No! This sucks. Stop! You guys would never do this. Together: Fill me with your spirit. Make me a shining city on a hill for you. No! No! No, no, no. Make me born again. No! In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen! You did it! Way to go, Morty! Crossy. Bible-saurus. You made it. We wouldn't miss this for anything! You said it, Mr. Celery. What the fuck is all of this?! Greatest story ever told, story lord. No, it's not. It's awful!  I beg your pardon? Ah! Goddamn.  My lord and my God! No! No! It sucks in here. Let's get the fuck outta here. Go, now. Ugh. We're safe, Morty. Nobody ever wanted to see that shit. Wh-what's gonna happen to story lord? He gets to spend eternity in every writer's hell... The Bible. I don't know. Some people actually like that stuff. Seems kind of cynical. I just don't like taking cheap shots, you know? Cheap shots? Morty, we were literally Saved by Jesus Christ. Tell me in any way how that's offensive. This was a little confusing, But I guess it brought us closer together, you know? Tested our demons. Made us believe in ourselves more than ever. Yeah. You're right, Morty. We got all that meta-canon shit outta the way And now we can just be ourselves. Now what do you say we bring this train into the station.  ?  ? Oh, shit. Morty: So what do you think? Wow. Where did you get this thing? The citadel of Ricks gift shop. Do you really like it? I didn't think you'd even care. What? Morty. No. I love it. You did the most important thing. You... you bought something. What? You bought something. With money. God. I love money so much, Morty. Are you being sarcastic? Merchandise, Morty. Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise. And you did it. You went into a store... an actual honest to God store... And you bought something. You didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints. You... you just looked straight into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said ""yes, daddy, please."" And I'm... I'm so proud of you. I only wish you could've bought more. I... I love buying things so much, Morty. Rick, are... are you... Do you need to go to the hospital? I love you, Morty. Give grandpa a kiss. Give... give... gimme... Give grandpa a kiss. Lips if you want. What... whatever you're comfortable with. Some cultures do that. That was sweet. Thank you. I... I love you. You're my little buddy. Okay. Let's watch some interdimensional cable.   So you're saying my father And his kingdom... Well, yes... it's based on the fusion of a sumerian God named ""ya"" And a mesopotamian God named ""way."" And we're in a toy train? Yes. It's enough to really make you question All of existence, isn't it? So what do you think you're gonna do about it? I'm gonna do what I've always done. I'm gonna get the fuck outta here. Father of omens! Give me blood beyond sight!  Hey, what the fuck, Morty? The train you got me just completely derailed itself. There's blood all over the windows on it. Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick. I guess I'll return it. Return... Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty. Consume, Morty. Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus. Where's your fucking wallet?!  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?"

4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,My name is Beth Smith. Tell your top bugs the Defiance lives on.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Beth Smith.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You could connect it to not dying.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Damn it. We risked our lives for that? You did your best.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,I don't have to miss it. I'm technically still there. My dad made a perfect clone of me to take my place.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Who cares? Are we done?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Dr. Wong had a cancellation today. Anybody up for a family session?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,I could do that. I'm... I'm down to clown.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet will be done in time."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Great, because she specifically asked you to stop bringing puppets. Dad?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"I love therapy, family therapy most of all, but I am actually disintegrating. Whoa! Oh, my God! Dad!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Is that really it? We did it? It's the invisibility belt. Whoa-whoa-whoa!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"He grazed them. That's gonna hurt in like 10 seconds. Thanks, Morty. Why should I let you use it? You never let me use it. Can I have the belt? It would really piss off Morty. Fantastic idea."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"What the hell?! You jerk! Give it! Hey! Ow! Share the invisibility. Jerry? Ooh, this looks like a job for Mr. Nibbles. Let me just glue one more eye on. I'm gonna kill you!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Woof. Looks like you two have to fight about why you can't control your kids. Good thing Dr. Wong's got an opening. Bye.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You're a bad father.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Don't let him divide us.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Garage, family therapy mode. Ah. Honey, you're back."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You seem surprised.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You never wrote.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,And never exploded?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,What I'm hearing is that you think that's a bomb.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,So does every engineer that's seen it.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Engineer? Princess, I'm sure every caveman that sees a microwave calls it a rock cabinet. The point of inventing is to make things that don't exist."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Then whip me up a reason not to kill you.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Dad? We're off to Dr. Wong's.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Scan her.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Dad?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth as Rick,"Okay, have fun, pumpkin. Sorry I'm a piece-of-shit father."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Oh, ha-ha! Well, the self-loathing buys a lot back."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Jerry, leave the puppet."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"It's a one-way ticket to a breakthrough, Beth."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,The device in her neck would have transferred a database of her memories to your device before vaporizing her. So much for that plan.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Why is she... it... why am I back with Jerry? I thought she was a copy of me.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"She is a copy of you. If she ran back to that dingleberry, that's on you. Want to grab a drink?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,All the time.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Good girl.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,To catch a predator.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,What the hell?!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Thermal goggles, bitch. Mom said share."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,You can't share invisibility. Take those off.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,No.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,So I'll just see you at cheerleader practice? Should I bring a poncho?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,All right! State your terms.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,Give back the belt. You take the goggles. Go away. We trade in an hour.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,Deal.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"How do you like that, bitch?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Iliked it more than my old belt. ""Tiny Big Man Junior""? You shoulda shared."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Random guy,What are you doing in my house?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,Did I wander that far from my console? They should put a warning on these things.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"So, we overrode the gates, and the slave rebellion took the capital. Pretty cool."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Very cool. My daughter, having space adventures. They are skewing a tad ""Star Wars""-y, though. Don't forget to have fun."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Well, I came back to murder you, not get your notes, but I'll remember to fart more while I'm saving the galaxy."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Okay, I'm the one that made this possible. It's not a competition. Of course not."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Just curious, though, if it were, would ""most wanted"" be first place?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You're fighting the Gromflomites?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Dad, they're trying to take over the galaxy!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Everybody in the galaxy tries to take over the galaxy. The trick is to be left alone by whoever succeeds. Eh, it's your hero phase. I had one, too. You'll outgrow it."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"No, you did. I'm not gonna outgrow giving a shit."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Oh, come on."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Way to give a shit. Next time, don't wipe it on your home planet. Oh, shit. They're gonna track down Beth."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You mean... Beth's clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Right. Beth's clone. What... What did I say? It really was nice seeing you again.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You're a monster!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,Still wanna share?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Uh, yes."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Uh, I can."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr. Wong,"Jerry, do you agree that the use of puppets makes you seem dumb and crazy?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"I don't think ""crazy"" is a responsible word to use in..."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,It is now. This is crazy. You're being crazy.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"They do it in therapy on TV. Well,"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,"TV gives British people prizes for baking, Jerry."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Tonya?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Tammy?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Tammya? Tammya.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I like your hair better this way. How's the stomach?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,What?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Hey! I only said ""hey."" It's not like I can do more than that."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"As much as I'd like to kill you, my superiors have some questions about the Defiance."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I don't have a...
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"I have a Defiance? Oh, God, I'm a clone."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,That's your defense?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"No, my defense is eat me."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Hey! Ah! We've been over this. All I do is say ""hey."""
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Smart guns, white-list human life. And the therapist.  Tammy, this is the office where my family works to better itself."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"What, and that makes it sacred?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"No, it makes it a place I've rigged with a lot of voice-activated escape contingencies.  These are all good points. I need to take a long look at myself."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,I'd like to discuss that.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"I don't discuss problems, I incinerate them. Everybody in the car. Everybody in my family, not the world. Jesus, Wong. Boundaries."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Dr Wong,I'm better than this job.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Your children are down there invisible, Jerry. ""Make a portal""? Father of the year back here."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Well, you're one to talk. You told me I wasn't a clone."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Y-You're not a clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"And who is that? Uh, uh, a clone."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Why would you make a clone of me just to send the clone into space?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Well, you didn't want to go, and I thought, ""Okay, that's cool."" But then I thought, ""Well, you know what would be even cooler is a space daughter,"" s-so I made one. And I put a bomb in her neck in case she ever came back."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Father of the year.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,She wasn't supposed to come back.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Why did she?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Well, she found a bomb in her neck. Wouldn't you?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Father of the year.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Shut up!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I'm tired of believing you. I want to talk to her.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"No, you don't. Jerry, do something."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Hey.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,He told me you're the clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,What do you think he told me?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You're the clone?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Wow, naive and attractive."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Wow, jaded and hot."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"I know this is bad parenting, but if you stop fighting, you both get McDonald's."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"How about I just blow my brains out, starting with hers?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Okay, Wendy's. We love Wendy's. I-I think they even gave us some money."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Drop it. Don't move!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"Everybody, shut up! You're all saying different shit. Wait, so there are two of them?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"More importantly, which one is mine?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Uh, neither, chauvinist."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Whatever. Take them both.  ?  ?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Cool beam. But let's bargain. I'm the one you really want.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Excuse me?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Uh, smartest man in the universe? Secret to interdimensional travel? Ask your bosses."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,"My bosses are bugs, Rick. You killed the old ones. The new ones are half my age. They know if you're left alone, you're a non-threat."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Oofa!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,We got the payload. Fire up the NX-5. Earth's going Ta-ta. You might want to do that thing where you find a new universe where you can suck yourself off.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You can't tell me what to do.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Tammy,Awesome. He resisted. We can shoot him.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Wha?i
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rck,"Just go with it, Jerry. Everybody, drop your guns... except for Jerry! Fucking classic.  Holy shit. Morty."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,And Summer.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,W-We worked together. That's... that's our arc.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,We went from siblings to invisible to working together.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"It's not ""Citizen Kane,"" but why compete with whatever's going on here, you know?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You made me go to a wedding. And you killed my best friend. I shoulda said that one first.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Ugh, guess the galaxy's most-wanted mammal needs her daddy to come change her diapie. Come on, kids, we have to go do a fucking piece of shit ""Star Wars."""
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Oh, am I not a non-threat now?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Summer, try unlocking that door by scanning your high-school friend's dead face."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Uh, I have... I have to pee."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,Pee on the floor. It's a Death Star.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Okay, but there's rebellion and then there's..."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Here, Dad."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,Perfect.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,What am I doing wrong?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Ugh, her eyes are closed. Morty, open the left one. I've got the right. She died the way she lived, overserialized. I'm gonna rescue your mom and her clone without revealing which is which. You two find the NX-5 and shut it down. I mean, don't die trying. There's infinite Earths. If you can save this one, it's gravy."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,Dream team rides again!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Oh, yeah, we're like Luke and Leia. Uh, except no kissing part. What's another famous brother-sister team?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Uh, Hansel and Gretel?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Yeah, right, those two were fucking. Dad, we need the belt."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,I can't go with you guys watching.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You're invisible.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,What if the pee isn't?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You know what? We don't need invisibility. Working together is our belt.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,That's our arc. Let's do it. I'm gonna go ahead and whistle. That's how good I feel.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Jerry,"Oh, God. I knew it. Ugh, this floor isn't level."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Are they gonna torture us?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,Unless you plan on telling them what I know. Last chance to guess who was the clone.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"You're his daughter. Just something about the eyes, the shameless abandonment of your family. However can I live with myself?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"One theory... I was designed by your father to live with myself, which would mean you made a conscious choice to swallow your dreams with cheap wine and dinosaur pasta."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"You know that's the kind Jerry likes, same way I know the only goddamn dream you'll ever follow is your shitty father's approval."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You fetch your shitty father's lemonade.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You cosplay as your shitty father in his 30s.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"More like dead alert. What else? What else? I wrote some stuff down in my Notes app. Let me just find it. Screw it. Beth, if... if one of you is still alive, you're my real daughter. If you're both alive, don't hurt the other one. She's just a clone. She's not worth it. I'm coming, baby."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,That piece of shit.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Bath,That piece of shit.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"I came back kill him, you know."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I'd like to help.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,It is now Phoenix Person.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"You're working for them? What did they do to you, BP?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,It is now PP. Where is Tammy?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Oh, don't worry about her. I killed her."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,I loved her.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Really? Huh. Then can I suggest, as an alternate name, Crazy Pussy Whipped Person?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,It's funny. I always wondered who would win if we ever fought.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,Then you were always a bad friend.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Morty, we had one grenade. He had a gun. Whatever. Come on."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You gave it away!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,You said we didn't need it. I wish you were never born.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,You were an accident.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"You kill a good bug, for a horse doctor."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Thanks, me. Maybe we could do, like, a ""Parent Trap"" thing together sometime."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,As long as you mean the Lindsay Lohan version.  Naturally.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"Hey, over here. Look at me."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,"I used to be invisible, but now I'm the opposite."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,I killed them! I-I did... I did it offscreen.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"God damn it. Morty, fix your underwear. I saw your balls for a second."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,That's on you.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Never thought this was how I'd die.  We're nowhere near Venice, and you're not a dwarf in a raincoat."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Step back. You're not killing him till we kick his ass, Bird Person."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,"""Tammy""","Bird Person, stop. It's me, that Tammy girl."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Phoenix Person,"Tammy, this is unexpected. I was told you were dead. That is ab-so-lute-ly not true. I'm more alive than I've ever been."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,Saved the day with puppeting. Only one with a decent arc. He does have his moments.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Mom, Dad! Mom. Uh, we did it! Morty became super visible!"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,Summer put my jeans in a laser!
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"Morty, look at your little balls! I know! Bring it in here, guys. Damn, this thing has twin turbines?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Morty,I'll forgive you for abandoning us if you let me drive it. That works for me...
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"I was just gonna give you space cigarettes. I love having two moms. And I love having two wives. Never gonna happen, Jerry."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,You jerk-offs ready to get the answers to your burning questions?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"What's this, Dad?"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"The memory of which Beth is real and which Beth is a clone, obviously."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,You mind-blew yourself?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,You... You literally don't even know which of your daughters is real. Of course you don't. Why am I surprised?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"I'm sure you'd love for us to need that from you, but I don't care what's in that vial."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Space Beth,"Yeah, me neither. You're a piece of shit either way."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"So what? After all this, you don't want to know the truth? The truth is we have more important shit to do like raise our kids and stamp out the Federation, neither of which seem like they want anything to do with you."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,"Morty? Sum-Sum? You gotta at least wanna know who your real mom is. Not really, Rick. We have two badass moms now. It's... That's kind of a win/win."
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Summer,"Yeah, Grandpa Rick, don't drag us into your bullshit just because you're losing control. k"
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,I know what I want to do. I want you to decide.
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Rick,What?
4,Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri,Beth,"For once in my life, I want you to decide, Dad. Do you want me to stay here and be part of your life, or do you want me to leave?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh shit, I almost parked but Morty hold on wat-watch this."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Uh-huh.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Well I thought it was cool. So should be in and out, simple exchange, not even an adventure. And if anything goes wrong which it won't, jump into the same vat of acid I jump into."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Okay. W-wait what? Wha-what vat of acid?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"What, Morty! Close the door."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"I pre-scouted this location and placed a vat of fake acid amongst the real ones. It's got air horses and a compartment of bones at the bottom. If things go wrong, which they won't, we jump onto the vat of acid and I'll release the bones, they'll float up-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,What is this face you're making?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Aren't you an inventor?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Yeah, what part of a fake acid vat with built-in air supply and quick release bones isn't inventive enough for you and when did my job become pitching you ideas?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Alright! Let's just do this. I have English homework.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You're still learning English? That's the language you speak. How dumb are you?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Intresting choice of meeting place, Rick."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You like it? My grandson had notes.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Come on.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Show him the crystals, Morty."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,I'll make lots of money with these.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I'll make lots of those with these.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Well, those are fake."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Come on."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You gotta be kidding me. Seriously?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You brought fake crystals and a gun?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,Beats real crystals and no gun.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Okay, but does anything beat fake crystals and a fake arm?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Whoa, do you know who I am?! Even if you kill me, you're a dead man."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Are you serious? Morty, he's right we're screwed. Let's just end it, quik death come on."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Aw, man. Oh!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Ohhhhh!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,The Dealer Group,"Woah, Hey, Oh My God!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,Holy Shit! What the Fuck?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Moustached Goon,Holy Shit.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,What kind of psycho? His own grandson?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Moustached Goon,Guess he took your threat pretty serious.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Yeah, but it just doesn't make any sense."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"Well, he was a scientist. Maybe he knew more about acid, maybe it's like the most painless way to go."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"How could that have been painless? You saw that pause before the bones floated up. That has to be like five seconds of unparalleled torture. I can't get my head around it. I, I thought I'd seen this galaxy at it's darkest. This is going to take a while to feel normal."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,"We're pretty good listeners boss, drinks are on us if you want to talk it out."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Thanks, but what happened, it happened here. I don't wanna lose the moment."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"Take your time, boss. We'll stay as long as you want."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,"Absolutely, I got nowhere to be."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"And then, little Tommy Flim-flam's running down the Hyperloop. His ass is on fire from Xenon fluid, but his AI hologram is fucking his own Pee hole."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,Great story boss.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Really detailed
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Yeah, well I got a million of 'em. All right, I think I'm ready to deal with the world now. Let's geet out of here."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Should we drop our buddy in here before we go?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Yeah, probably a good idea."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Should we use a different vat? Does acid lose its acid power the more it dissolves?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"What am I, an Acidologist? Here grab that rat-like creature. We'll do a little test."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Look, if you the damn acid, don't use a rat. Take that ladle, grab a spoonful and put it in the analyzer."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"I'd say that's pretty acidy, drop him in."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,What are you doing?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,You said-
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Not the rat, the guy."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,Ohhh!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,Look at the size of the bones on that rat.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Mustached Goon,"Oh, how many sets of bones this rat got?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Black Coat Goon,"Look how the smaller ones are shaped, their like little cartoon bones. Like if you dreaw a bone in art class."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Lead Gangster,"Alright that tears it, I'm cancelling of the rest of my night and calling a bone scientist. We're getting to the bottom of this-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Jesus Fucking Chist enough already!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,The fuck is wrong with you?!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Just admit is was a shitty idea!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Having a grandson?!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"A vat of fake acid, are you dying of dementia?!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,How are you talking to me like this? Wh-whe-When did you get so cocky?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Tonight! Tonight Rick. The night I saw you fail.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Because you ruined it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,It was pre-ruined!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh was it worse than when I was a pickle? Oh-oh-oh, that's right, you weren't there for that, turns out kind of cool. Maybe there's a connection there"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Excuse me?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,What's that cool thing you did without me again? The awesome thing? I-I-I guess you wanted a dragon ?*Does a chef's kiss Unforgettable.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,God fuck you
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Timely too, you really got in that ""Game of Thrones"" fever right at the peak"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You trying as hard as you can to hurt me right now proves my point.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I'll let you know when you have a point and the world will know whe I try to hurt you.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Big man, big genius, big lonely drunk."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Hey save some of these atomic-age beatnik zingers for your English homework, Bukowski."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,RIck,"There's no such thing as a bad idea, Morty. It's about execution."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"No such thing as a bad idea except all of mine, right?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Morty, wanting a dragon isn't an idea."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"I'm not talking about that! I'm constantly pitching you ideas, Rick, and you act like they're not even worth thinking about."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"What, the helicopter lawn chair? That's just something you saw on TV."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,What about my video-game-style place-saving device?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh my God, here we go."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"It's a good idea, Rick! A device that lets you-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Save your place like in a video game but in real life so that you can try stuff and then go back to your save point, yes Morty, I saw it on ""Futurama."""
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Oh, so you don't do anything unless it's original?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I don't do time travel.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"It's not time travel, it's saving a place in time-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Oh my God, is this what you think I do? This is where the heavylifting happens in your mind? Do you have any idea how much fucking work would have to go into a machine that-"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Ah-ha! You can't do it.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"I can do anything, Morty. Your idea is not worth doing."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You can't do it.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Before what you're trying to do was called ""negging,"" it was called ""reverse psychology"" and incels didn't incent it, Bugs Bunny did."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You can't do it.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,There is nothing I cannot do.
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,A place-saving video-game thing!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,You're a piece of shit!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Just say you can't do it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I won't
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You won't say you can't?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Fuck you, Morty!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Fuck you!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Fuck you!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,So are you gonna-
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Yes, I'm gonna fucking do it!"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Rick, it's 3 am..."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"You were right Morty sighs I failed, I can't make it. And honestly I'm pretty ashamed, that might be what I've been so aggressive and unfair about rejecting your ideas."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Rick..
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"A vat of fake acid, Morty? Maybe I've lost it"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,H-Hey cmon you know I didn't mean it that way. I just think we need to find better ways to communicate
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"I'm sorry I just... lash out sometimes. I-I-I don't know what I do that, I am so ashamed of myself. Hearing you talk about the vat, it really opened my eyes. Like what the fuck am I even doing"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,"Hey-Hey I don't like hearing this talk, you're a great inventor, we just got a couple of things to work on, let's start with inventing a little honesty, sound good?"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Thank you Morty, sounds good. Or maybe I'll just kill you"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,What? Whoa Whao Whao Whao Rick
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,Because I fucking did it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,You did it!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,I did it you son of a bitch!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,How did you?
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"Morty do you want me to explain, or do you wanna go have fun"
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,I wanna go have some fun! Rick this is this is thank you
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,"You can thank me later, go nuts."
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Morty,Best grandpa ever!
4,The Vat of Acid Episode,Rick,that's all I ever wanted to hear
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Space Beth,"Jerry, I had sex with your wife."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I did it. I fixed portal travel.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jack,Jack the Ripper at your service.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Cool
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,This happened too?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Summer,I'm pregnant.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jerry,"Honey, she's just like you."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,It's raining meatballs.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Okay, something is-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Priest,Jerry Smith died doing something he loved. Getting stung by bees.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Off what?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Have some respect. It's dad's funeral.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Summer,I'm gonna name you Jerry Jr.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Tony,Thanks for solving that murder guys! Here's a skateboard.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Aw thanks Tony Hawk.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Morty, say you'll marry me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Just say yes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Yes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Okay?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Rick, do you promise-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"I do, and for our honeymoon, let's go to a, sealed chamber lined with ionized deuterium."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Why?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Cause the charge acts as a narrative decelerate. Morty, none of this is real. We're in a ""previously on"" spiral. Clear your head."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,After all that's happened?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,No.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Beth,I'm innocent! I didn't release the bees! I love Jerry!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,What did I just say?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,When?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Okay, great execution. Let's go back to the chamber."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Now repeat after me Morty. Next time on Rick and Morty.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Next time on Rick and Morty.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,"No, previously on Rick and Morty."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Ignore it Morty. Next time on Rick and Morty. It counteracts his toxins.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Next time on Rick and Morty. Who's toxins?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Hey stop it!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Previous Leon! Grab him!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Hang on tight Morty! We gotta get through the opening titles!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Opening titles of what?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,And we're back
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What just happened? Why was there music?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Cause of this conceptual little piece of shit. Grab his feet.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"If we have opening titles, does that mean we're in a-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Let your body purge the meta-venom Morty. Don't succumb to his pointless self-aware bullshit.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,"It's not pointless, it's cool."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He's got a gun!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Eat lead pussy!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, no, no. Fuck!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Son of a-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He can use a portal?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"He wishes. He wriggled back into the meta-layer through the hole in the fourth wall.  Put these on, and help me find it."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I don't like this Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, you shouldn't. It's not a likable premise. It's funny when I do a little nod to the viewers but-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What viewers?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"That's the right attitude Morty. A few carefree verbal asides, always by me. None of this season 3 moonlighting shit. Okay, here it is."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Your going to patch it?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, he subverted actual reality Morty.  He needs to be put down like a rabid dog."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Ow fuck!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Oh yeah. You don't wanna wear those over here.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Maybe he went down that road
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, no, no. If he took that, he'd end up a hero."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Dammit Rick. I don't like this. Is this whole place just-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,A bunch of groan-inducing wordplay for seven TV critics that won't even enjoy it? This is worse than you think Morty. We're basting in meta radiation right now. Our credibility is being permanently eroded. Every second we're in here is equivalent to 10 Space Jam cameos.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,You should've thought of that previously.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Get him!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Oh no!  Bless me heavenly father. For you will save me
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Now I feel bad. Let's just get out of here.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Because he prays? You know Hitler was Catholic right?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,I'm here Leon.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Okay he apparently prays very well.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Time for you two to meet the Lord.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"It's okay, we're good. Treat it like a bear attack Morty. Walk backwards and make yourself look big."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I love a good refusal to call. Hello Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Hello, Amish Juggler?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,His name is Story Lord.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Story Lord? Listen, trust me. Take Amish Juggler, you can have it."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Story Lord! Rick, he's the villain from the toy train I bought you."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Very good Morty. The fictional versions of you trapped me in a Bible show for children, but I used make-believe Christ to transcend fiction and enter meta-reality. Now, I'm the one doing the trapping. Leon was the bait."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Bait?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Jesus?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You're using Jesus to beat us up? Have you seen South Park?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Good call-out Morty. That's the kind of meta I like. The kind that keeps us creatively accountable.  Oh, not the Bane, not the Bane.  He Baned me Morty. Jesus Baned me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You can't beat me up. I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm technically a Christian child.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,And I'm your worst nightmare. I'm the Jesus from every Jesus joke. The one without a god.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Morty, take this and go."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Thank you! Looks like Story Lord's story is about to become based on real events.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,What do you want from that?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I want what any character wants. Motivation.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,What?  That's dumb.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,That's lazy.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Wait what? He just left.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Kinda wanna make you our unlikely ally huh?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Previously on Jesus Christ.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,"Hey, I'm Jesus."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mary,I'm Mary
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,That's my mom's name
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mary,Stop!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Disciple,She's a hooker.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,She's a better disciple than you!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Oh no! I can't die.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Soldier,I have a proposition for you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,I work alone.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Dracula,"If I suck your blood, I'll be invincible I think."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,You'll never know
6,Full Meta Jackrick,News reporter,Billionaire immortal entrepreneur Jesus Christ has placed all his money into what he's calling a second chance at love.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,Hang on Mary!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mary,The data! So beautiful
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,"Make me normal, witch."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,"Take this, haaah!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Nurse,Eat your pudding Mr. Christ. What are you smiling at?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Jesus,your name.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What's happening Rick?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Leon's venom makes you think more and more of your life is behind you as he feeds on your released potential.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Leon, you saved our lives."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Oh, not yet he hasn't."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Jeez Rick, so mean?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,He's meta Morty. His life doesn't matter. Yours does. That's why we need to get back.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Well this doesn't look like the citadel.  Maybe it's cooler on the inside.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,This isn't what it looks like. This is a very special diet for very successful writers. Why do you look like my character?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"I am your character, and you are going to improve me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,But you're Story Lord. You're great.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Great isn't good enough. I killed Rick and made myself real. I'm better than some shitty toy train. Is this your office or your apartment? Why does it smell like you sleep here? You are my creator. Why are you pathetic?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,Because you failed.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,And who's fault is that? What the hell happened?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"You wanna know happened? Like specifically? Well the Ricks wanted to do a Canterbury-tales type of thing, but none of them fucking read Canterbury-tales, so then they told me to make it like a poker game episode of the Batman cartoon, where the bad guys tell stories about Batman. Then they tell me it needed something. Yeah, no shit it needed something. I needed to ever be pitched. I did my job. Goomby, the Ice Queen, the Tickets Please Guy. They just bailed on it. The website didn't even fucking work. There was a shitty URL to begin with. Story-dash-train? Who uses a dash? They set me up to fail. They fucked me. They fucked me, and you're lucky I didn't blow their brains out."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Right, just give me motivation you hacky fart."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Okay, here's your motivation. Looking for motivation. You want all the motivation."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,That's lazy.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,It got you this far. Must be nice by the way. Wish I could afford to dress like a bisexual acting coach from the 70s.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,My motivation is motivation.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Okay, bye."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Oh no, my bitter friend.  You're coming with me."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yo, if you don't see me coming, it's a bad fortress!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Where are we?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Headquarters of the Self-Referential Six. They're meta nerds that found out they could be less bearable as a team.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,They can help us?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"No, but there's a prisoner in here who can. Shh! Don't tell them that!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Miss Lead,Rick Sanchez! I've been waiting for this moment for years.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Oh good. Morty, this is Miss-  Lead."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Miss Lead,I should kill you where you stand.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I brought you Previous Leon. You'll want to lock him up in your detention center.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,It's a trick. He wants you prisoner.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You dick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Miss Lead,Liar!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Talk about a mislead. Anti-meta field.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Flash Back,Fancy device. I think I can recall the time you built it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Don't try it Flash Back!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You know I'm excited about the upcoming election.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,This force field will be impenetrable by meta-energy. It runs on hydrogen isotopes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Flash Back,Hmm.  Hydrogen isotopes!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Connie Tinuity Error,A few barrels of petroleum should dampen it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Run Morty!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Connie Tinuity Error,Were those not there before? Guess there has been a Connie Tinuity Error.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,These people are the worst!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I told you. Way overpowered.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Look out Rick!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Forget him. He's a nameless guard.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,That's Protago Nick! His beam has the power to make any character the protagonist.  Duck!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Marvin,Oh man! Oh man! Oh man! Ah! What are you doing Marvin? Not dying. That's what I'm doing.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Katie,"Oh, what's going on? What happened?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Marvin,I did it again Katie. I ran out on another job.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Katie,"Well if you didn't do that, you wouldn't be my man."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I was almost tempted to let it go. That's how much I hate it here.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Smash cut!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Remember me Rick?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Who's this guy now?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,I am Mr. Twist.  The fifth member of the Self-Referential Six.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Who's the sixth?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,That's the twist Morty. It's you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Ignore him Morty. The twist is that there's no sixth member, and he tells that to everybody."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,"In any case, you're ours now. You can't free yourself without a twist, and I control them."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"You don't control every Twist, Mr. Twist. I got a twist for you."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Impossible. What is it?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Nice try. Like I didn't see that coming.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,Fuck me!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Great work Morty!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I'm adapting!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Here's are ticket out of here. We got him in a cell made out of spores, because it's the opposite of story."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Do I wanna ask who he is?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,His name is Brett Caan. He has power is to make things always have been other things.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I think that's called retconning. His name is Brett Caan? Rhett can also be a name. His name can be Rhett Caan?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,"Oh it is, and it always have been, now."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Woah!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Careful Morty. Stay clear of his retcon range. Until he agrees to help us.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,Help you. You've always trusted me.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Nice try. Here's how it's gonna work. You're gonna make it so that Morty and I never came here. Once that's always been the case, I'll free you remotely with this."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Machine,What is my purpose?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,To wait until I tell you to pull the lever.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Machine,You are fucking kidding me.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,"If you don't free me right now Rick, I can make very very bad things always have been the case."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Is that a threat you fuck. Y-y-you can rot in there.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Rick?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You know what Brett. Forget what I said. We have always been friends.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,Good one.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Connie Tinuity Error,Woah! Easy Brett. Don't forget that coffee mug I gave you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,You were always been able to be killed by coffee.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,New plan Morty. Run. Again.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Mr. Twist,The twist being-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,You were born without bones.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,There has been nothing outside this fortress.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,God dammit!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Brett Caan,The fortress has always been an orange!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Great plan Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, I'm not pushing back on that Morty. I have really fucked us."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Ugh, it hurts."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,We've been past the fourth wall too long Morty. We won't be real for much longer.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,You've killed us Rick. You just had to hate meta storytelling.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"In my defense Morty, I think you have to agree, my hate was justified."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Least earned death ever.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Death is a threshold.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Huh.. what- what happened?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,You were cold.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Who- who are you?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"I'm Joseph Campbell.  Soup? I almost considered not making it, because my name is Campbell, but then I thought, stay in the moment Joe. Follow your bliss."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,How are you here? Brett Caan said there was nothing.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Some things never change about mythology. There's always an old man with soup. Name one story that doesn't have one.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Uhh Jack in the Beanstalk.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Basketball Diaries.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Every Matrix.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Every movie ever.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"Alright, I don't have to defend myself here."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Where's my soup?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Previous fucking Leon. Why is that prick here?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,He's no more a prick than you friend.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Meta characters erode reality.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"But all characters are meta Rick. All of us are nourished and consumed by chaos, like newborns at the breast of a meth addict in a lifeboat filled with forks."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I know what you have to do Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Scrub Campbell's browser history?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Just trust Previous Leon. Can you previously us a way home?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,I sure enjoy trying.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, I bet you would."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"Rick can't change Morty. Change is what you might call his Kryptonite, except instead of being super, he's you know. Kind of a pussy."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Let's do it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Previously on Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Get him off! Get him off!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He almost killed you!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Well I feel bad. I kinda pressured you into trying-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You calling me a pussy?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,I said I feel bad.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,This is a map to a region rich narrative ore. I wish you the best of luck.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Faster Morty! I'd help but I can't blister my inventing hands.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,How long will it take?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Years.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,You can live in my wood shed. Just don't open the door after dark.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Why not?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Person at the door,Come out you communist Jews!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Dude, maybe I'm not an alcoholic."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I know right.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Person at the door,You fucking Back to the Future ripoffs!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,It's ready.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Rick, I should stay."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Why?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I'm pregnant.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What are you doing? It wasn't him Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Well then who?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Me! I never left! But you had to think all this had happened to make that.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,So I can take this through the titles.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,If you hang on tight.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,What about my beard and unborn child?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Previous Leon,Let them go.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Thank you Leon.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,"When you get home Rick, do some classic adventures. Like season 1-"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I'm so sick of that fucking note. What the fuck does it even mean?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Now one last time, what's my motivation?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,Motivation. This machine will siphon it from everyone in the universe.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Perfect! Green lit! Launch it!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,"Yes, it's working! I can feel it! Something I'm doing is actually affecting someone!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #1,I don't wanna work anymore.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #2,"I do, but there's no excuse to not practice guitar."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Putter,Why don't we write any number down on the score sheet?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Person watching Putter,Why even do that?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #3,Wait you have to register?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Yes! I can feel it! I'm so motivated! I want a lot!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Story time's over.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Hardly your decision.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Did you seriously double down on motivation as your motivation?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,It's a good idea!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"There's no such thing. There's joyful and there's joyless, and we've had our fill of one."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Morty, make that sweaty writer stop working, while I kill off this character."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I have never been more driven to destroy someone!
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Yeah, well I'm driven to lower my blood sugar, but guess who's getting tacos after he kicks your ass?"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,So you're jacked. Who cares?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Cum gutters.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,I don't like that phrase.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,I don't take notes.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,You can't beat me Rick.  I have one million times your motivation.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,So do those guys with the cell phone kiosks at the mall.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,The hair is wrong.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Like you'd be picky about licensing.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Actually I do. I happen believe that-
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,You can do that?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,You gotta want it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Come on. Just stop. I-I don't wanna fight you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Kid, I'm a writer that ruined something successful. So if you want me to give it up, you're gonna need a black belt or a great pair of tits."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Yeah well I don't have those.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"In the mythical sense, I am both."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Joseph Campbell?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,Nice try. He died in the 80s.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Joseph Campbell,Only you can see and hear me Morty. Just repeat after what I tell you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Okay.  Sir, you're only proud of your creation's success, because you want to be creative, but creation doesn't happen through gimmicks, technology, and distribution. It doesn't even happen through work. Creativity is frankly adjacent to mental illness, and overlapped with it substantially. A lot of talented people kill themselves, and all of them are miserable. The real gift is to be ungifted, and from what I saw in your Green Arrow script, that's the gift you were given."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,You couldn't have seen that.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,I'm Joseph Campbell. I saw it.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,The villain was a placeholder.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"I said I saw it Jan. I didn't say I could get past page five. Your villains aren't the problem. The problem is when you write, you're a villain. If you wanna be a hero, just stop."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Worker #3,You know what? Maybe I will register.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Tell me I'm the new Mr. Nimbus.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Oh. Looks like your writer took a hiatus.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,Ah fuck.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"You're less motivated to fight now, so this is literally punching down, but you saw it coming."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,You failed me.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,No. I failed you.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Story Lord,All good things must come to an end.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"All bad things do though, so don't flatter yourself."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Joseph Campbell says you're the one that has to put him down.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,"Wait, wait, wait, Joseph Campbell also says you have to use this brand new limited edition Rick plush  available only on rick-plush.biz. Supplies are limited. Act now."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,He did?
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,"Jesus, that's the last time I buy a toy from a Rick."
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,The plushies are obviously well made.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Morty,Thanks for getting us back alive Rick.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Rick,Well I am a master at both worlds Morty.
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Writer,"Joseph Campbell told me to stop writing, because it should be effortless, and when it happens organically, that's what it's meant to be. You know like umm like me. I'm a writer, here's a pencil. Writers use pencils. Okay so like, what if the pencil used me? Like okay yeah, so it's like a magic pencil that writes the writer's life. Holy shit it's a movie about a writer. I'm back!"
6,Full Meta Jackrick,Tag Man,"Yeah, I'm Tag Man. I-I-I live in the tag. I-I-I am the tag. I'm Tag Man. Tag-tag of the episode man.  Did you get any of that?  Yeah, when the episode's over, look out because  Yeah, here comes Tag Man, and I go crazy. Tag Man yeah.  I'Imma tag your ass. Tag that ass.  Tag Ass Man. I'm that Ass Man now.  I'm Tag Man. Here's what you get. Here's your tag. You want some more? You want some more tag, you sick pieces of shit? Cause I'm Tag Man.  I miss my wife. Too bad. This is it. Tag Man yeah."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Ugh, guess this is how it ends. I thought I was better than this. Dramatic voiceover while stranded in space? I-I guess when you're dying, the first thing to go is your creativity. Citadel's gone, and-and the saucer we escaped in is out of power."
6,Solaricks,Alternate Morty,"Oh man, I'm so scared in here ¡®"
6,Solaricks,Rick,The extra Mortys went feral¡®
6,Solaricks,Alternate Morty,Gahhhh!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"¡®Eh, some problems solve themselves. Been drinking a lot¡®Morty! I told you to write this down! I-I don't have a helmet like that Avengers guy did!¡®been drinking a lot of my piss. Portal Gun's still broken."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Guess that was all part of Evil Morty's plan.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"""Evil Morty"". Can we stop flattering this guy? His plan was to monologue and fuck off! He basically threw a tantrum to announce he was quitting twitter!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Nobody quits Twitter.  Hey, remember, like a second ago, when you pretended to not know who Iron Man was. Who was that for?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Shh, shh, shush, Morty. This is how we go. Bear it with grace.  Spinal cord, Robitussin as a base, then surprise me."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Mom!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Beth, maybe!"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Is she trying to say something?  We-we can't hear you! How dumb are ¡® Beth, you're in a vacuum, sound travels on air!  Why am I yelling?"
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,IS THIS A PRIVATE PARTY? OR CAN ANYONE JOIN?
6,Solaricks,Morty,Wow. Great.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yeah, that's ¡® Wow. Really worth it. That was not worth it! It's corny!  You! Corn! Dying of starvation here!"
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"WHEN I DECIDED TO SAY IT, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE ¡®"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Oh my God, stop explaining!  Stop explaining!"
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,¡® SUBJECTED TO THIS SCRUTINY.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Are you finished?  She's not finished.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,MAYBE I WON'T RESCUE YOU.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh, real mature!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Oh, nice."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Real classy.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"It was a good line, honey."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,I didn't need it to be. I don't care what you think.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Oh my god, she found you. Here, eat. Eat."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Oh hell yes!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Hold on, buddy. Our systems could go into shock from solid food.  Digestibot, convert to nutrient mass."
6,Solaricks,Rick,I'm just gonna risk it.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Since when do you guys get stranded?  Thank you, by the way."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Almost left them out there.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Portal travel's broken.  Mmm. Are these heirloom tomatoes? Digestibot, try these."
6,Solaricks,Digestibot,Yum. Yum.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,So you can't hop realities anymore? Does that mean you'll finally have to wash your robe?
6,Solaricks,Rick,Good point. They need to reboot the Portal Index immediately.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Basically just a hard reset on the fluid. Hold tight, the Earth's gonna shake a bit."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Uhh ¡®
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,Oh!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh, shit."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, what? What's happening?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Instead of resetting portal travel, I may have reset portal travellers. Too late to apologise."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Rick, why am I pulsing green? And don't say you don't know, because you're pulsing green."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Rick, are we about to die?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"No, we're about to vanish from this reality."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,That's totally dying!
6,Solaricks,Rick,No it isn't! It's everyone from this reality returning to their reality of origin.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Back to our original universes!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"I explained it fine, Morty. You're spoonfeeding spoons. Where is Summer?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Oh nice, you guys are back.  Whoa."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Summer, three of us are one-way blind-hopping. You gotta help us get back. There's a protocol for this in your chores server, filename 'Booger-Aids'."
6,Solaricks,Summer,Every file is 'Booger-Aids'!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"I¡®I hate naming things! Just search for words like 'one-way blind-hop, reset map beacon'."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,Why do I have a reality of origin?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"There's no time to explain, Jerry. Counting on you, Summer! One-way blind-hop beacon protocol.  Here we gooooo!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,So there was time to explain.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Don't waste extra precious seconds with your pettiness, Jerry!  Summer, let's run down¡®"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"One-way blind-hop reset beacon, 'booger-aids'."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Cool.  Wow.
6,Solaricks,Jerry,There was so much time to explain!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yes, fine! Hindsight is 20-20. Who has ever taken this long to vanish?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"How did I end up not in my own universe?!  Oh, my god. The Jerryboree."
6,Solaricks,Rick and Morty,Oh! The Jerryboree!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Deep cut.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Wait, but where's our real dad and our real Morty?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Buried in the backyard.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,That's what the possums are after.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Dad's got you in the family business too, huh?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Yeah, Morty's an easy mark, but Rick pays me in things like ¡®"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Wolverine claws.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Well, looks like you got this. See you guys in another¡®two years?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Or you could stick around for this one? Looks like it involves Grandpa's grotty citadel.  We could, you know, break things, loot stuff."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,I should ¡® probably get back to ¡® saving the galaxy.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Please?
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Guess I could loot some stuff. Fine. Yeah. Okay. Let's make it quick.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Awesome, I've never been. Let's do this. Okay. Adventure family. Woo!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Uhh ¡® Okay!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Fuck.
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this."
6,Solaricks,Voice,"Rick, is that you?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yeah, Diane."
6,Solaricks,Diane,You've been gone so long.  Did you find our daughter's killer?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Not yet, sorry. Still looking."
6,Solaricks,Diane,"You'll find him. You always do everything you set your mind to, except keep your family alive. But that was hardly your fault."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Mute.
6,Solaricks,Diane,"If I could be muted, I wouldn't be too-too-too good at haunting you, would I, you dirty bear?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Yeah. I forgot I wanted to be haunted.
6,Solaricks,Diane,"I guess you predicted you might. That's where haunting comes in handy, huh?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Very good point, sugar."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Rick?
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Hello? Original family? Sorry about last time. Rick, he was in space prison. We couldn't just¡®hello?"
6,Solaricks,Morty,Aaaah!
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Aw, geez."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Ah!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Oh!
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Agh! Ah, fuck! Dammit Morty, there's no doctors anymore."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Dad!?
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Figures it's underwhelming, the one time I visit."
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Yeah, sorry, usually, there's cowboy Rick and Mortys and stuff."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Looks like they could use a couple repairmen Ricks and Mortys, right?"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Oh, tight! Little scavenger dudes. If they shoot at us, I'm allowed to ¡®"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"do this.  Shit, yeah."
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Space Mom, get in on this!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Cool Mom.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Let's keep it moving. I don't have all day.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,I got it! I got it.  Sorry!  Sorry!  I got it. Sorry!
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,I was ¡® gonna do it ¡®
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Ugh, terrestrials, am I right?"
6,Solaricks,Diane,I kept up the search in your absence. You want a new list of potential locations?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"You're always just one room away, huh?"
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Yeah. Remember, if you thought you could see or touch me, it might give you a level of  com-com-comfort."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Right, can't have that. Come on, Summer."
6,Solaricks,Diane,Who's Summer? Should I be jealous? I hope  Summer knows what happens to the people you love!
6,Solaricks,Old Man,"Hey, Rick!"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Hey, Mr Goldmanbachmajorian. S-still alive, huh? What's up?"
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,"I was hoping you could help me make sense of a note I found this morning? It's written by someone claiming to be me. They say my mind is 'held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.'"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Right. I used to drink drink.  Uhh ¡® no clue pal.
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,That's okay. I found other notes in the trash just like it. Poor weirdo. I pity them. Wish they could let go and move on.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Sounds healthy.
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,Sure would be!
6,Solaricks,Mr. GBM,"Aaah, sweet death!"
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Was that symbolic? Are you letting go? I understand, baby. I forgive you!"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"You don't get to say that, you're not her! You're a thing I built to torture myself.  This whole fucking timeline is cursed. I gotta get out of here."
6,Solaricks,Diane,Because you want to move on.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Because I don't! And  I have to. I came back on accident. The guy I'm looking for, he's... he's not findable, Diane.  I live with a version of Beth now."
6,Solaricks,Diane,Sounds like a version of nice.
6,Solaricks,Rick,We have grandkids. That's who Summer is. She's going to get me out of here.  She reminds me of you.
6,Solaricks,Diane,Oh really? Is she dead too?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Bye, Diane."
6,Solaricks,Diane,"You're not honestly going to fly into that rift without coordinates, are you? Don't give up on us, Rick. I don't make the rules. Haunters gonna haunt."
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Baby, are you killing yourself?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,I'm more embracing the win-win of risking my life.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Where's Mom and Summer?
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Oh, they're gone. Sorry, Morty."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Gone gone?
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"We spent a long time in that ice. A gentle mutant licked us out, but Beth got sick and Summer... didn't thaw right."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"With no one left to blame, I finally had to deal with myself. Buried my grief at Barnes & Noble, ""Four Agreements"", ""Eat Pray Love"", Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"". Learned to accept things for what they are."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"In a few of these, the whole brain is still intact. Makes you wonder if some people were still in there,  just trapped in the horror. Anyway, it's awesome protein."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"I'm so sorry, Dad. But my real, original Dad beat the apocalypse. I-I-I guess we all underestimated you. Hey, w-what's that game we always try to play as a family, y¡®the one we never finished?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Downbeat.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Yes! Let's play Downbeat. I-I bet I can find it! We can finish now!
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Yeah, you should totally do that."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Hey, yeah, cool, I-I got it! We'll play Downbeat and we'll-we'll camp here tonight and then rebuild the house.  You know, we got food, fresh water, and we've got family."
6,Solaricks,Morty,The fuck?
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Morty. I wrote this note in advance in case you're wondering how I left so fast. My plan is to wait for you to turn your back, them I'm going to grab all your shit and split. Depending on how long you were out of the room, you'll probably be thinking I can't be that far away and you'll want to foll¡®"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Morty, wrote this fast 'cause had to set trap. Thought you'd have cooler shit. See other note. Bye."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Motherfu¡®
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,Not cool! Oh!
6,Solaricks,Morty,"What the hell, Dad?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Don't take it personal, Morty. That's one of the Four Agreements. I don't remember the other three, but I know Commissioner Gordon was cool with Batman moving on."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Batman doesn't abandon people!
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,You abandoned us.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"I deserve that. But, you know, it... it improved you."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Oh, am I cool enough for you now? Well, that was easy, it only cost me fucking everything!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Whoa, hey, I-I¡®"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"You came back and talked about us like we weren't people, Morty! Then you bailed and left us to freeze!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,I-I was apologizing for that earlier¡®
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Your mom and sister died, Morty!  And I moved on. From caring. And that is the best deal you will ever get. So take it."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Please don't go! I-if Rick comes back, we ca-we can find you a new reality. A new Mom, a new Summer, a... job!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Oh, you don't get it, kid. Except for this conversation, my life is perfect. Rick was always right.  Everyone needs to let go."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Aww, you came back. I guess we really did form a bond."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Ow! Hey, stop it! Get away from me!  No! Help!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Alright, pin dropped, Grandpa!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Come and get us.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Come on, come on, come on!"
6,Solaricks,Diane,"Baby? Something to keep in mind¡®if you were pulled home by whatever happened, it's likely our target was, as well. It's also likely he's having as much trouble leaving as you are."
6,Solaricks,Rick,He's trapped.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Grandpa!
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh, fuck yes!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,Grandpa¡®Grandpa?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Summer! Gold star, always believed in you. N-now the hard part."
6,Solaricks,Summer,Hard part?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Way worse things than me can see that beacon, too. Hunker down and protect it while I grab Morty. Rick out! Try to survive!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Oh, shit.  Domestic Mom should hide, maybe?"
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"""Domestic Mom?"""
6,Solaricks,Summer,"I mean, she's the cool space one."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Look, I'm not looking to get caught in whatever this is. You guys can both hide maybe, hash it out."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Oh, quit talking down. I'm you with the patience to do laundry."
6,Solaricks,Summer,"Mom, stop being jealous of our bond!"
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,She ran from our choices. I have to parent them.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,It's not like I didn't care. That's what the clone was for. Aah!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Moms!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Morty!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Rick? I knew it! I knew you wouldn't leave me!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Ow! The fuck?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Morty, did you see another Rick here? Nondescript haircut, sci-fi jacket?  Eh, of course you didn't see him, you'd be dead. Or you'd be a bomb. Do you feel bomby? Nah, you woulda blown up by now."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wasn't the Rick here dead? Th-th-that's why you pick places, right?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Uh, well, your Rick, uh, yeah, not dead, more like, not around. When I met you, I was sorta hoping he might turn up one day¡® You son of a bitch! I got you!"
6,Solaricks,Morty,W-w-where are we going?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"To kill your grandpa, little buddy."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, what?"
6,Solaricks,Morty,I don't understand. My original Rick killed your family? And you were just waiting for him to come back?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Seems like you understand fine, Morty. That was A+ re-piping.  We're here."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"This guy, Morty, he hates being found but loves building elaborate shit. Like-like-like playing a ton of Minecraft but all on a private server."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Am I in a fucking K-hole right now? What is going on?
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Whoa-ho-ho, you found me!"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"I shoot the first monitor, too. Listen, I'm not here. Or am I?"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"There's the clone you found! Or maybe it's me, all naked! Just a lil' Keyser S ze. I mean, why would I admit it's not?"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Oh-hoho, yeah! Look at him! Look at him go! Look at him dance! O-or me. Again, it might be me, like a ""Saw"" thing. I'm very sneaky. Here's a bunch of killbots to deal with while ya wrestle with that."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Obviously, I don't know who I'm talking to here."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,It's all prerecorded.
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"But if you got this far, you probably think you're real special. Tell you what?"
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Oop! There he goes! Maybe that actually was me! If you follow him down there, we can do a big fight. Fifty percent chance I'm not lying."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"We're in trouble, asshole! I shouldn't have to beg."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, my moms are in trouble?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Those versions of them are.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"W-we gotta save them! Rick, this is an obvious trap. If you go down there he's just gonna kill you."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Good!
6,Solaricks,Morty,What?
6,Solaricks,Rick,Now what?
6,Solaricks,Morty,"If you don't care if you die, why do you care if I die?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,Knock it off! Get out of here! You did this last season! You're like a suicide bomber!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Takes one to know one.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yeah, well, you get it from him, not me."
6,Solaricks,Morty,"I don't know him. You're my grandpa, Rick. Rick and Morty. A hundred years."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"This place totally might go up, by the way! Here's a bunch of countdowns! One of them's probably accurate."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Ah, fucking stupid 5th-dimensional stomach juices."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Sorry for the sitcom fight, and maybe getting us digested."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,You've got incredible timing.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Oh, don't be a bitch. I'm parenting. Makes sense you don't recognize it. You've been out of practice for a while."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"Good! I'm glad that they have you! I don't want to be ""Space Mom."""
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,You've made that clear. Just don't let Summer mistake your rejection of her for good taste.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,I'm not trying to. It's all her!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Jesus! It'd be cool if you were around more. I don't wanna get married. I'm 17. My affection is the wind. Don't try to compete for it.  I could hear every word of that through the helmets. Thank fuck I only had to kill most of them.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Jesus, that ship really has sailed."
6,Solaricks,Space Beast,And now... we feast!
6,Solaricks,Rick,This emergency was oversold to me.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Grandpa!
6,Solaricks,Home Beth & Space Beth,Morty!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Moms!
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wait, i-if they had to wear helmets¡®"
6,Solaricks,Rick,I do childproofing stuff while you're asleep.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Why don't you childproof Dad?
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Ah, great reminder."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Wait!
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,Time to get Jerry.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Ugh.
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,Maybe I wouldn't be so uptight if I wasn't married to an unemployed receptacle of human fear!
6,Solaricks,Summer 5126,"Get a job, Dad, it's been a decade."
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,"Whoof. Pretty brutal, Jer. I-I know a good alligator park if you wanna kill yourself."
6,Solaricks,Morty 5126,I got expelled today.
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,"What the hell, Morty?!"
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,"Oh, no, you got expelled. Whoa, what a horrible thing."
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,You are so fucking dumb!
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,"Too bad, Morty."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"Hi, hon."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Whoof, some real Season 2 vibes in there, you know what I'm sayin'?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"You know, never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm glad we spent that time divorced."
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Eh, one second."
6,Solaricks,Rick 5126,I'll build a fucking swing set in the backyard!
6,Solaricks,Beth 5126,What the hell Morty?
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"You know, I may technically be from here. But I'm a goddamn interdimensional traveller now, and all of you¡®¡®can kiss my sci-fi ass."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,It gets me every time.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Wow, what an amazing joke I just told. A-and also, what an adventure. You know, I guess it doesn't matter where we're from if we're together, huh? Good-good final moral thing."
6,Solaricks,Summer,This is everyone's original dimension now.
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Great wrap-ups, kids."
6,Solaricks,Season 2 Jerry/Jerry C-131,"Ugh, you're back."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Oh shit, Season 2 Jerry!"
6,Solaricks,Season 2 Jerry,"Look, before you bust my balls, can someone help with the shower? It's colder than Beth on her anniversary. Also...  Look what I found in Rick's room!"
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Season 2 Jerry,"I don't care how cute he is, we agreed! No Boogens in the house."
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Wait, Season 2 Jerry! Don't!"
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,Nyaah!
6,Solaricks,Morty,Oh!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Mr. Frundles!
6,Solaricks,Rick,Everybody in the car.
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Wait, but I thought he was Mr. Frundles."
6,Solaricks,Rick,Everybody in the car! Now!
6,Solaricks,Many species of Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Beth,What the fuck Dad?! Why would you bring that thing into our house?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"It was cute! Fuck we gotta find a new timeline now! You know how hard that shit is without portals? We gotta do the thing with the Rift and the beacon again! The whole fucking episode all over again! Car, fabricate some vomit bags."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,Can't we just go back and fix it?
6,Solaricks,Mr. Frundles,"Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!"
6,Solaricks,Summer,I can't believe portal travel's broken.
6,Solaricks,Rick,I'll get to it when I get to it.
6,Solaricks,Morty,"Lift with your knees, Mom."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,How many times have you done this?
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"Oh, God."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,And you swear they die of natural causes?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Mm-hmm, yep."
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,The exact same as our old timeline? Even my stuff?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Bit of a rush job, actually, so they do say ""parmesan"" weird."
6,Solaricks,Morty,How do they say¡®
6,Solaricks,Rick,Par-mees-ian.
6,Solaricks,Summer,Boo.
6,Solaricks,Jerry,Jesus Christ.
6,Solaricks,Rick,I could've left you guys! You think the concept of family matters to me? I'm not even your Rick!
6,Solaricks,Summer,Uh-huh.
6,Solaricks,Jerry,"""I'm Denial Rick!"""
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,"See you inside, Dad."
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,Sorry I was such a Dance Mom about Summer. She's your daughter too.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,"No, boundaries are good. But, uh, speaking of, maybe I've put up too many. Is it okay if I come around sometimes?"
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,That could be nice.
6,Solaricks,Space Beth,That's a cute outfit.
6,Solaricks,Home Beth,The one we always wear?
6,Solaricks,Rick,"Yes, Morty?"
6,Solaricks,Morty,"You promise I'm not, you know, bait? T-to make that Rick come back?"
6,Solaricks,Rick,"What? M-Morty, for you to be bait, the guy'd have to value something. He truly does not give a shit.  He's the real deal."
6,Solaricks,Morty,Parmeee...san...
6,Solaricks,Rick,Par-meee-sian. Par-meee-sian.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Par...par-meee-sian.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Par-me-sian.
6,Solaricks,Morty,Gross.
6,Solaricks,Rick,Yeah.
6,Solaricks,Morty,I hate it.
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Hello? Morty? That one big Rat?
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Whoa, this is a development."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Gah!
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Shh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lil guy. Easy. You're a Jerry, right? Never got too close to the concept. Boy, you have really arc'd out."
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Were you putting on pants?!
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"What?! Oh, yeah. No, I was naked to fuck with a guy. Speaking of, did you talk to me, or a little kid around here?"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,"Maybe. Why? Because if you hate them, too... I could be down for a little team up."
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Eh, I really don't ""team up"" anymore. Managing people, such a headache. Aah!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Fatality! Jerry wins.
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Oh, goddamn dude! Badass!"
6,Solaricks,Jerry Prime,Why are you here?
6,Solaricks,Rick Prime,"Buddy, I have been asking myself that exact same question."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"Yeah, yeah, h-hold on, one sec, left a bag of funyuns down there last week. Didn't want to waste our time. Okay therapy me"
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Do you need to take that?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,No just the president
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Maybe we should turn off the phone
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Thought you might think it was cool.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,You like it when people think you're cool?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You're extra analytical today. Looking to remodel your kitchen?
7,Air Force Wong,President,Sanchez! I know you're in there when I call you directly it's an emergency.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,I was in therapy Don't stigmatize mental health
7,Air Force Wong,President,how rude of me Hello I'm the president
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Yes I recognise you
7,Air Force Wong,President,Oh? how nice
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,It's not nice to recognize a president can we go
7,Air Force Wong,President,In 1961 the CIA secretly relocated the loch Ness monster to lake Erie and replaced her bones with titanium she was then but by several werewolves giving us the ultimate anti submarine weapon
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Got it
7,Air Force Wong,President,But the Soviets smuggled in a reprechuan who turned Nessie's bones into silver giving her the were version of aids. She sank to the bottom we assumed she was dead but she was only asleep now she's awake and hungry.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You can't date my shrink
7,Air Force Wong,President,What?! Bro you're nuts
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Then don't date my shrink
7,Air Force Wong,President,I'm not dating your shrink! She probably doesn't even like me.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Tell him to stand down! Would you let him bang your therapist?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,What the hell does that even mean you don't believe in it?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Don't date my shrink! And don't be a space Mormon! Why not?! It's silly! Sorry it's a cheap shpt. Worship how you want. I like Tom Cruise
7,Air Force Wong,"Ooh, welcome back to Mr. Stabby! Let's get another question from the audience! Audience member",Ow! Augh!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Mr. President.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"I've got an emergency, Rick. Another President mission? Y-You just killed the Loch Ness Monster for him."
7,Air Force Wong,President,Tell that little bitch to zip it.
7,Air Force Wong,Morty,You can't talk to me like that! T-Tell him he can't talk to me like that!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You can't talk to Morty like that. Whatever. I'll portal over. I've seen this one anyway. The audience dies.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Rick, thanks for coming. We've got a situation in the state of Virginia."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Bigfoot?
7,Air Force Wong,President,That's Montana.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Nazis?
7,Air Force Wong,President,"That's, uh...everywhere."
7,Air Force Wong,Carl,"That's an exaggeration, sir."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Jesus, Carl, you, too? The problem in Virginia is... love. You've heard the state motto, ""Virginia is for Lovers""? Well, now they've codified it into law. Virginia has declared itself literally and exclusively for lovers."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Sounds boring.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"It gets worse. There's no crime, no poverty, and suspiciously, no complaints. The governor just hit 100% approval rating. And that's worse? 100%? Get on the web, Dwayne. There's no such thing as 100% of anything. America knows and incinerates a cult when it sees one. But I can't do that to all of Virginia, so we need to infiltrate."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,I volunteer to do acid to prove I'm not a cop.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"No lone wolves. We need a crack team for this one. Rick, meet Fleeflak. He might be able to tell the future."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Might?
7,Air Force Wong,President,"We're waiting to find out. Onyx here is a weapons specialist, and our eye in the sky is my chief of staff bot, Chi-Chi. Sleek. Yes, an excellent team. Eh, but there's something missing... a psychology expert, perhaps."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"Oh, f ck me. You pretended to need a crack team so you could get Wong's number?"
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Get her number? I own the CIA. If I wanted, I could get her genome."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"So you wanted what from me, permission? You got it. It's a free country, so you're always saying. That's certainly all I'd be willing to pay."
7,Air Force Wong,President,You're making me choose? You or her?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,There's three billion women on this planet that have nothing to do with me.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Can you blame them?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You suck.
7,Air Force Wong,Fleeflak,Wait! Danger!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"Wow, that's great, buddy. It's goin' right on the fridge."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"I appreciate your lending your expertise to this mission, Dr. Wong. Gum?"
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"No, thank you. I was surprised to receive your call but excited. I haven't done field work since grad school."
7,Air Force Wong,President,We think the people of Virginia have become some kind of hippy s x cult.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"I haven't done that since grad school, either."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Ho-ho! Dr. Wong, you are a firecracker!"
7,Air Force Wong,Mayor,"Halt! I'm so sorry, Mr. President, Virginia is closed to visitors."
7,Air Force Wong,President,I thought it was for lovers. I'm a lover. You guys lovers? Mm-hmm.
7,Air Force Wong,Mayor,"I appreciate that, but the rest of your country doesn't need Virginia's love right now."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"You know, the last time a state talked that way, we had to have a whole thing."
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"And this time, the other side has nukes."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Well done, Doctor."
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Call me Helen.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Communist bastards.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Communist bastards! So, what happened? Tell me the secret."
7,Air Force Wong,President,How unsettling and cryptic.
7,Air Force Wong,President,finally your religion comes in handy! No! My only chance at meeting Will Smith!
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Pick up your phone asshole when I call it's an actual emergency!
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Rick?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Unity
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Take it easy. Take it easy. I can explain just let me get things under control.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,you controlling things is the explanation and we agreed you wouldn't do it where I work
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,what the fuck are you spraying me with
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"A new scent I picked up after you left I call it ""Separation'"
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,You concocted a me repellent?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Does that look like a bad idea?
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Rick are you in a relationship with the population of Virginia
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,We dated
7,Air Force Wong,All,I just want to talk.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"I'm pretty sure you have trillions of cellphones. No, come back! Let's talk!  ?  ? Thank God you had a crack team with you."
7,Air Force Wong,President,Where's Helen?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"""Helen""?"
7,Air Force Wong,President,She initiated first name. Whoa! Call in a chopper! I'm being cock blocked!
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Rick... it's me. I was released from Unity.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Cool. So you won't mind if I spray this.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"I won't, but we're surrounded and Unity knows your reload time. I really believe you and Unity should talk."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,How would you know? You're just a nutritionist.
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"When you work in nutritionism as long as I have, you get a certain feel."
7,Air Force Wong,All,Calm down. We came because we're worried about you.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Why?
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,"We hear things, Rick. I tried calling, but is it true you're looking for...him again? You almost died last time."
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,That's none of your business.
7,Air Force Wong,All,You're our business.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,You quit that business! And you're fired from that business! And I'm using your last paycheck to cover the stapler you stole which was my heart!
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Civil War, baby!  Sorry! That was supposed to be suppressive!"
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"Thank you, Andre."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Thank you, Helen. It's time to put these bastards on ice. Cue up the dome!"
7,Air Force Wong,President,You'll need a second date for that answer.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Barf.
7,Air Force Wong,News Anchor,"A nation in turmoil tonight as the entire state of Virginia continues to be trapped inside an energy dome. The White House released a statement dismissing the President's shouts of ""Civil War, baby,"" as hyperbole. Shonda, what do we make of that? More like Hyper Bully, Tom. Oh, sh t. Shonda came to play."
7,Air Force Wong,Shonda,"This President has been in office for how many alien invasions? Not to mention the mutant turkeys, the abandoned White House orbiting our planet, the eco-conscious dinosaurs. Then he sees Virginia with its perfect economy and synchronized lawn mowing, so he shoots them and puts them in a dome? Classic Curtis."
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Will someone mute the goddamn news? If I want a list of my failures, I'd dig up my mother. I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry, that's a turnoff, right?Guy screaming about his mother in a war room? Sanchez! America hates your dome! How long is it going to be up?"
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,"Rick, I agree that my accepting this mission was inappropriate. When I was invited, I didn't know --"
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,That he was hitting on you?
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,I was aware of potential romantic motivations. And I was open to them. Bam. But I did not know you and I would be crossing paths.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"You mean you didn't care because, on one hand, you got professional ethics and, in the other hand, you got world-famous schlong."
7,Air Force Wong,President,Now I get to beat you.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Bring it.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Put it through.
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"You couldn't. You suck. I'll do it. Mr. President. Lady, you bring that ship to America's planet, I'm launching 4,000 warheads, 3,000 of which will turn out to work. Then I'll call China, and you're really f ck d."
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,"You've made it clear can't be friends, Rick, but I need to reconnect those people so I can properly release them. They're hosting a mindless collective. If it connects to another mind, it could become its own colony."
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,"I needed you to understand how serious this is. I can handle it. We got the spray, b tch!"
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,Don't talk to them like that.
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Do you not trust me Rick?
7,Air Force Wong,President,Who would?!
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Let Rick answer.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Baby I know you want to help but-
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Andre I think we need to move slower.
7,Air Force Wong,President,"Slower? I haven't even touched you, and you're already back seat war rooming."
7,Air Force Wong,Wong,Andre.
7,Air Force Wong,President,Helen.
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Rick?
7,Air Force Wong,Rick,"I don't trust you. You ghosted me to focus on your work. Your work is absorbing the universe. But it's my universe. Please go. Well spray the Virginians before they touch anyone. I'm sorry you lost a finger, but that's the price of surprise butt play Goodbye"
7,Air Force Wong,Unity,Goodbye
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"A ""rake situation""?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"Long story short, I asked Gene if he borrowed my rake, and he said, ""No,"" like...like that. Like, too fast. Like, faster than someone should know they don't have my rake. I think he has my rake, and I..."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"No surprise there. All that brain, and you just waste it."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,H-Hold up. I-I waste my brain?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"Yeah, Rick. Obviously you were born smarter than me. But if I had your brain....but if I had your brain... - If you had my..."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,Are you gonna kill me?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"I was born crying and pissing myself, just like you. Then I become the smartest man in the universe, and do I get credit? No, I get to check my brain privilege."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,So we're swapping bodies?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"No, that would be ""Freaky Friday,"" which is the ceiling of your grasp of consciousness. The brain is part of the body, Jerry. It's hardware. I'm gonna put my mind in your brain and your mind in my brain. Then we'll see the real definition of ""waste,"" Jerry. Or, you know, admit genius isn't random and your failures are your own."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Oh, furck. Oh, grod."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Wait, no!"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Oh-ho-ho, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"All right, Jerry, you can do this."
7,The Jerrick Trap,GARAGE AI,Medical emergency detected.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,"I'm telling you, man, you're making a big mistake here."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,Y-You guys have milkshakes?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Your body? Jerry, your mind did that to my body using my brain. Jerry, my mind was in this brain in your body. Pretty easy to follow."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,It shuffled us.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,Shuffled you maybe. I'm tracking everything.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,Garage? Fix this.
7,The Jerrick Trap,GARAGE AI,Situation was fixed.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,So that's where my paranoia went.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,Rick speaking. Who is this?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Chuxly,"Rick, it's Chuxly. From Crimetown."
7,The Jerrick Trap,RICKBODY,"Wait, w-what? Aren't you describing kidnapping?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Give me that, Jerry. Hello? Hello?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,This is Rick Sanchez. I'm using my son-in-law's vocal cords because I'm amazing.
7,The Jerrick Trap,CAR AI,Figure out how to drive me together
7,The Jerrick Trap,GOON,"Looks like he's inbound, boss."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"This is my... assassin. Deadliest man in the galaxy, and he's gay."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,Why am I gay?
7,The Jerrick Trap,GANGSTER,Whoa.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,Why is Dad here?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Cruxly,Your dad's a gay assassin? So cool and ordinary. Sorry. S-Sorry.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"It doesn't matter, Rick. The guy's already kissing your ass."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"It's the ass kissers you have to keep in line. When they sense weakness, they move on you."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Cruxly,"Actually, Morty, why don't you leave those crystals here since it's such an insulting amount."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,"Look, here's the deal. I'm Rick, that's my son-in-law, and we're all a little gay."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,"T-They made us stop at every drive-thru chain in the galaxy, so they could make one giant burger with a patty from each place."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,I guess I meant before that.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry body,And Jerry'd still be hung up about the rake.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,Kinda thought two geniuses would build faster than one. When do I start being concerned about this?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Just having a little fun with my new friend, sweetie."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,Who is talking to me right now? Mostly my dad or mostly my husband?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick body,"Oof, I've been on that website."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,"Look, I've been patient, but I can't tell how to get mad at who. No one enters my room or touches me until this is wrapped up."
7,The Jerrick Trap,CONSTRUCTION WORKER,"Beautiful day to be carrying glass, huh?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,BOTH,Life tastes better when you're chugging.
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRYBODY,"Forget it, Burger."
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRYBODY,"Whoa! - RICKBODY:  Oh, man."
7,The Jerrick Trap,DRINKBOT,: somewhere.
7,The Jerrick Trap,MAN,The voice mailbox for...
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRY,"Uh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Did it beep?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,CHUXLY,Just an average mid-tier crime dork.
7,The Jerrick Trap,JERRYBODY,We've smoked most of what we stole.
7,The Jerrick Trap,BETH,Jerry?
7,The Jerrick Trap,MORTY,Rick? Grandpa?
7,The Jerrick Trap,BOTH,Morty. Summer. Daughterwife. You are safe now.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,Yes. I am Jerricky. Wa-chah!
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,Do you not hear the symphony of atoms dying in space?
7,The Jerrick Trap,Gene,"'Scuse me. Are... Are you Jerry? Sorry, you have one of his heads."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,I am Jerricky.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Gene,"May as well have your rake back, then. That's right. I took it. I ask myself, ""Why lie about it? Don't you think he knows? Couldn't I get my own?"" Of course I could've,"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Summer,"Well, it's fucking lame, okay? Both of you walking out on Mom? I thought you had two sets of balls, not zero."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerricky,Our balls are adeq...
7,The Jerrick Trap,Summer,Hold him down!
7,The Jerrick Trap,MORTY,Garage! Garage! Help us! Hold him down!
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Jerry, being shuffled with me was probably the best part of your sad existence. A brush with greatness."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Hey, Beth, how much integrity is left on the mortgage?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,Dumb. fucking dumb. Go pick up crystals for me.
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"You don't have to do that, Morty."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Morty,"No, it's... it's okay. I-I like doing it."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Beth,"Welp, those horses won't sew themselves up, but good to have you both back. Yeah. Whatever."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Great, so I still wind up stuck with Jerry's dumb ass?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,"Oh, fuck you. Eat your eggs that my wife bought."
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"How about you eat my shit, you Hawaiian-shirt-loving twat?"
7,The Jerrick Trap,Jerry,Uncalled for! Rude and uncalled for! You sit there with your potty mouth
7,The Jerrick Trap,Rick,"Jerry, it's not my fault that nobody respects you in here. Oh, yeah."
7,The Jerrick Trap,MEMORY RICK,Day of attempting to escape Jerry's mind.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Oh, good, are we having this fight again? L-let me guess, y-you¡®re gonna leave or, or throw a sulking fit?"
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"You think you know everything, Rick, but you¡®re basically just a giant 8-year-old."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"I¡®m not doing this anymore. Either you¡®re in or you¡®re out, Morty. I¡®m tired of you weaponizing this half-assed threat. You want out, then fucking quit!"
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"You know what, you¡®re right. Sorry to be such a high-maintenance Morty. Why don¡®t I get you a drink?"
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Hey, Rick. You drunk yet?"
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"You¡®re my little buddy,  you know that? I-it¡®s you and me, Morty. Rick and Morty, 100 years. Forever."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Yeah, pal. Rick and Morty, 100 years. Forever."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,G-g-get off me. W-w-what are you doing? Ahhhh!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,An eye patch? You know how we feel about pirates.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Rick,Do your worst you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Ahh, just another day in paradise."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Motherfucker!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Well, not the stealthiest technique, but if this guy doesn¡®t know I¡®m hunting him, he¡®s not worth hunting."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"It¡®s just good to see you outside the subbasement. Even if you never kill the version of yourself that killed your wife. Giving it your best shot, it looks good on you."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Thanks, buddy. It means a lot that your bar for mental health has gotten lower than mine."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Merging dimensions to consolidate my decoys, huh? Kind of¡® first-thought, but the¡® craftsmanship, pretty impressive. For a lesser Rick."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,What the fuck are you doing?
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Oh, shit! Evil Morty! Sho-should I grab the net?!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Yes! Hang tight, Morty¡®s getting the net."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Wait. Is this what I think it is? Of course it is. Everything¡®s what I think it is. You¡®re basically fracking the Central Finite Curve to flush out a version of yourself? Shouldn¡®t you be turning yourself into a pickle?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,What do you care what I do to the Curve? I-I thought your whole gimmick was fucking off. Certainly what made me a fan.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"You¡®re right, I don¡®t live here, which is why it¡®s insane that you¡®re still bugging me."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Why would I touch it when I don¡®t want it improved?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Improved?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,You¡®re hitting infinite targets. At least filter for probability stasis.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I was gonna. Duh.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,I can¡®t find the net! Sh-should we just shoot him?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,You really think a douche that smug doesn¡®t keep a force field on?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Yeah, listen to Pop-Pop, Morty."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Eh. I¡®d be an idiot if I didn¡®t check.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Uh-huh.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,He¡®s filtering for probability stasis.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,You¡®re acting like this one¡®s different.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He is different. But different doesn¡®t mean him. Could be a trap.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I¡®ll explain. He¡®s worried that it¡®s actually your target and he¡®d owe me credit for the kill.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Are you serious right now? You little narcissist.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Dude, literal glass house."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,You think you¡®re better than me?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Jesus, I hope so!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Can I offer my two cents?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Everybody look at the bright side. Evil Morty got to experience being wrong before he died.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"It¡®s true, that¡®s what I get for talking to you instead of killing you."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,What is this place?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I assume a box to contain Ricks that get too close to the big guy.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Are you basing that on what you¡®d do? Since you¡®re all the same.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I¡®m basing it on the ensemble of thematic Ricks huddled opposite your POV.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Instead of Ricksplaining how we all ended up in a Roach Motel, let¡®s pool some data. Who got here first?"
7,Unmortricken,All,We know.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Looks like there¡®s enough of you to start the next ride! That or just one really heavy Rick. This whole thing is automated, which I do point out specifically to enhance the humiliation. Here we go!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"If you¡®re seeing this, you¡®re me, except, you know, less. But you acted like you were better, so I killed your beloved Diane. Partly to devastate you, mostly so I only have to record one message. Some of you may have noticed that it¡®s not just your Diane that¡®s gone. She¡®s also been erased from every universe across infinity. And you might be wondering why."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I¡®d rather hear how.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Diane was wiped from all existence by The Weapon Too Cool for a Name.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,The Omega Device.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Known to inferiors as The Omega Device.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I heard the name from an inferior.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"And it¡®s my weapon. But it¡®s your fault I had to use it on her. So if you want to see the Rick that ruined your life, look around. There¡®s so many of you. But that¡®s why I want to make a deal. One of you is going to get your Diane back."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He¡®s lying. He¡®s lying!
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,All you have to do is be the last Rick left.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Got that out of your system? He can¡®t bring her back!
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Eh. Pass.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,You¡®re such a dick! We could¡®ve worked together!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I thought you wanted to ¡®work together.¡®
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Just until you could kill him!
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,And they call me Evil Morty.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,The easiest way out of any box is to be the least shaped like a box. We both hate Rick Prime more than each other anyway.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Where¡®d you get that?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He¡®s the worst Rick.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Big deal. The worst turd is a pizza.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Seems like he doesn¡®t play well with others. We all cool just killing this guy?
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Great job, final Rick! Or if you were just one fat Rick, impressive cardio! And now the big reveal. Do you get Diane back? Not in any real sense, because when I build a weapon, it works. It¡®s called being talented. But I do have a Diane that promises to be with you until death. But I¡®d get to the death part fast. You don¡®t want to be in here when this place resets."
7,Unmortricken,Diane,Rick?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Hey, Diane."
7,Unmortricken,Diane,You sucked at eating pussy!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Clearly just said to be hurtful, but I also won¡®t deny it. I was young."
7,Unmortricken,Diane,I always thought your dick smelled weird!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Or that.
7,Unmortricken,Diane,"Come on b-baby, g-give my g-ghost a k-kiss. Mwah."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I¡®m excited for this. Clearly no one¡®s escaped that place before.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Really learned your lesson about chasing this guy.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Hey, man, you can leave now."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"That¡®s true, I can."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"The weapon, Morty. He knows a thing that wipes someone out across all dimensions could wipe him out across all dimensions. Holy shit."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Can¡®t help it, I¡®m a rascal. Morty, you can¡®t come! Evil Morty, stay out of my way! Gonna kill my nemesis! Rick out!"
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,He¡®s a weird guy.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,So Rick¡®s right? You¡®re afraid of the weapon?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,What happens if Rick actually kills this guy? You ever think about that? Maybe he¡®ll kill himself next.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,You¡®re an asshole.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Well, yeah. I¡®m not ¡®Good¡® Morty. Come or don¡®t. I don¡®t care."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Oh. Shit.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Got to be honest, I totally thought you were coming."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"No, no, I- I was. I-I took a heroic step toward the portal, but then it closed."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Yeah, yeah, come on."
7,Unmortricken,A.I.,What¡®s up?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,He built it again.
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Well, yeah, he¡®s me with free time. Alright, I don¡®t see a place to park. Catch your breath and then keep that heat off my back."
7,Unmortricken,Car,"If you die, I¡®m taking your stuff."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Ugh, gross."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,What? No one can do undercuts but you?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,You brought Morty?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I¡®m not worried about him. I¡®m evil!
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Alright, here we go!"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Wow, the Wife Guy! Dead Wife Rick! I¡®ll tell you, this guy does not know when to quit."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I¡®m gonna fucking kill you.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,You brought two Mortys with you? What? They¡®re your cheering section?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"We brought ourselves, asshole."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Honestly, Wife Guy, I do miss when it was just us. The only two Ricks who actually invented portal travel. Anyone else teed up to arrive later? Like your car?"
7,Unmortricken,A.I.,I can see why you hate him.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"And she sounds like our wife! Like in a fucked-up robot way but that¡®s definitely her voice. You sentimental little fella. Right, good instincts. I would¡®ve tried that, too. I upgraded this thing, by the way. The new version can fire more than once. So now I can erase your whole family, one-by-one, until you finally learn your lesson. Which you won¡®t, so then I¡®ll kill you, too."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"I¡®ll do that the old-fashioned way. Okay, family killin¡® time! Let¡®s start small. Still family though."
7,Unmortricken,Slow Mobius,Where am I? Two Ricks? Where¡®s my wife? I was just with my wife!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Uncle Slo!
7,Unmortricken,Morty,What the¡® Uncle Slo? Slo Mobius?
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Yeah, this one hurts me, too."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,No-o-o-o-o-o!
7,Unmortricken,Rick,I¡®ll kill you!
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"So, uh, original grandson. This is super weird. Obviously we¡®re, uh, both trying to kill each other."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Aw, jeez. Nice to meet you, I guess."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"So, do we¡® should I just get this over with or¡®?  Cool grandson."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Shitty grandpa.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Why am I wearing an eye patch? And wait. Did we¡® did we switch shirts?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Yeah. Thanks for the assist.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Rick, we¡® we did it. Evil Morty got him! Rick? Rick!"
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Alright, you two punks stay here."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Okay, I think I¡®m getting the pic¡® Ow! Frying my backups, smart. So you¡®re like an evil Morty. A clever one. Ow! Alright, never been a sidekick guy, but I¡®m starting to see the value. You want a job? We could be like Batman and Robin."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Eh, I don¡®t need a Robin."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Okay, seriously, what is this? What, are you gonna ¡®aw-jeez¡® me to death? Oh, you don¡®t want those schematics, buddy. Those are for grown-ups."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Uh-huh.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Oh, isn¡®t this great? Okay, alright. I get it."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,"Oh. What? Oh, shit."
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,Mm-hmm. Knock yourself out.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Listen, Rick to Rick, he¡®s got the weapon plans. Buddy, nip this in the bud. He¡®s 14. What¡®s gonna happen the next time he gets mad at grandpa?"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"Let¡®s do this then. You¡®re welcome, by the way. I made you. I showed you infinity."
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,"And what did you do with it? Hang out with my grandson, raise echoes of my daughter?"
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,What¡®s your life without me?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Let¡®s find out.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,Admit it. You would¡®ve been me.
7,Unmortricken,Rick Prime,I just walked into your garage before you walked into mine! But eventually you did! You lived in my house!
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Rick! Is it over? Is¡® is he¡®?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Not exactly an ¡®alive¡® amount of blood. How¡®s it feel? Better? No? Exactly the same? Yeah, it always does. Hope you¡®re happy with your choice."
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Fuck off.
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,I¡®m gonna. Just don¡®t force me to improve on the design. I can end the Rick experiment any time I want.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Why threaten? Why not just do it?
7,Unmortricken,Evil Morty,"Because using a weapon like this doesn¡®t get you left alone, Morty. Think I want a bunch of vengeful Summers coming after me? You are a little different though, Rick. Maybe I can use that someday. Seriously though. Fuck you. Don¡®t come after me. It won¡®t go well."
7,Unmortricken,Morty,Are¡® are you okay?
7,Unmortricken,Rick,Yeah.
7,Unmortricken,Morty,"Phew, man, when those drones uncloaked back there, I was like, ¡®Oh, shit, this is¡® We¡®re fucked, we¡®re toast!"

5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,"Rick, Morty, and Summer","Boob World! Boob World! It's a world for you, but it's actually two. Boob World!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I gotta say, Morty, it's weird that you wanted me to come, but I'm actually ""exstyched"" about it. That's ""excited"", ""stoked"", and ""psyched""."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I didn't want you to come. Talk to Rick.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Truth is, Summer, Boob World's been at the center of a few protests every day for 30 years, so they've recently rebranded as a ""boob empowerment experience"", and if we bring a female, we get in for free."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"So, I'm like, what, a Coke can you're taking to Six Flags?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"No, 'cause once you get into Six Flags, you can throw your Coke can away."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,No fuckin' way. It can't be.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, look at that."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,What is it?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,A Gotron Ferret.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"It's not a Gotron Ferret, Morty, it's THE Blue Gotron Ferret!  Boob World is canceled."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"No! Rick! No, you promised! You always do this."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Tell you what, Morty, I'll let you choose, do you really think Boob World "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Yes.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Let me finish.  is more important 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Yes!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Let me finish!  than having all five of the only five Gotron Ferrets in the universe?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Are you finished? Yes! So let's go.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Summer, help me hook the winch up to the ferret."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Sure.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,What the hell? You said you were letting me choose.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Yeah, whether to break my fucking heart. You chose badly."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,That's how it all began. To my sister it was just another game. But what she didn't know 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,That was the moment everything changed.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Wait, what?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"I had gotten my first taste of respect, and my first voiceover."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,I can hear you. Can you hear me?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"And I knew then and there, I wanted more of both."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,Hello?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Beth, Jerry, do something fun with us! A giant monster's attacking in the Nibblenug system. Your suits are in the bathroom."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Mine smells skeleton-y.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,I have a chiropractor appointment.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,What are you involving us in?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Rick's been collecting Gotron Ferrets, and now that he has all five, he can combine them into "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Morty, for Christ's sake, spoilers!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Spoilers, Morty! We don't need to sell this to anyone, there's a giant monster attacking."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"In the Nibblenug system. Since when does this house care about alien lives, we don't even watch"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Told you. Let's just get Gene from next door and a homeless guy.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"No, hold on, fuck Gene, fuck the homeless. Your kids and their grandpa are asking you to do an activity with them, when did that stop being a parent's wettest dream?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,I guess around the time our family created a giant incest baby and the government launched it into space.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Oh my god, we made a giant incest baby. Oh my god, you might be a clone. I exist because you guys failed to abort me. We get the family we get, not the one we want, and if you want to keep the one you got, get your asses into some anime spacesuits!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Fair enough.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Okay.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Good work, Summer-camp."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Yeah, I'm ""excitoked"" about this."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Sure you are. Now.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Something new was forming, and I was at the bottom of it."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"I let Morty have his voiceover, it's really all he had left."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Okay, can you hear me, or not?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"You mean, can I, Summer, hear you? No, my voiceover can hear your voiceover."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,What's the difference?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"One would be telepathy, dumbass."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Now what?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Now we 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,"Rick, Morty, and Summer",Go Team Gotron!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Where are we zip lining through futuristic metallic tunnels to?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Each robot ferret is on a different location on Earth. You're going to the center of a volcano.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Thank... you?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Okay, well, this isn't not fun."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Regroup on me, I'll shoot a portal to Nibblenug."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Did I just monorail from my kitchen to Hawaii just to regroup in outer space above my kitchen?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Uh, Summer?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"It's cool, Dad, shut up."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Everybody, attack one at a time."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Is that the best way to 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Tee up something awesome? Yes. Follow me.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Guys, we did our best, but there's only one hope. Activating linkdock, intermorphs, ratify, postatrinos, maximize."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Holy shit, I can't believe this is working. Go, Go-Team! It's Gotron Time!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Oh, my god. Hell, yes!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,This is amazing!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Okay, now we can knock it around a little bit, but trust me, we're still building to something."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,How do we 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Just hit buttons, we're too big to fail!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Wooah! I kicked him, that was me, right?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Uppercut!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,I can't believe I almost went to the chiropractor.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,I've been waiting a long time for this. Form Luminous Energy Sword!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Got your ass, mamma-jamma!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, that was fantastic!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"...tits, Grandpa."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Suck tits!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,I was a foot! I was a goddamn  foot!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"We were like, ""Bwaaah""!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"'Member when the sword was like, ""Bwaaah""?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I feel so alive!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"These were the good times, when we felt like we could do anything. But anything is never quite everything, and pretty soon..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Tch, that was nothing. Nothing compared to what I can do. There are infinite universes where I still don't have all five ferrets. Those versions of me would do anything to complete their collections."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Okay, but Rick? Remember what you told me to remind you? Sometimes enough is..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Sometimes enough is enough.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Morty, what are you doing?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"He gets obsessed, Summer."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,When are you going to find your shame?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I have more?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Grandpa just gave everybody the high point of their lives, and before he did, every single one of you was trying to talk him out of it."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Wait, yeah. What the fuck?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Now he says we can go higher, and big surprise, it's time to drag him down again."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Well, I vote."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"No voting, no debate, it's not a democracy, it's a Rick-public. You're in or you're out."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Obviously, I'm in, I never said I wasn't in."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Me, neither. Tell us what we're doin' next!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,I want to put together a cookout.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,That's it? I was honestly prepared to blow someone.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Jerry.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"I said prepared, and someone."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Rick invited five versions of our family from different universes, each with incomplete Gotrons. I didn't have anyone to talk to, since the other four Mortys had been to Boob World."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty 1,Did you walk on the beach?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty 2,The beach that's all boobs?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty 1,"No, the beach that's all sand. Yes, the boob one!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Rick was in the garage with the heads of the five families. ...Ugh, and Summer."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"In that first sit-down, it was Big Fat Rick; Ricardo Montoya; Hothead Rick, he got that name because he was prone to dramatic outbursts; and Little Ricky Wrap-it-up, who was always great at the end of a meeting. At the head of it all: me, and Grandpa Rick."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,"Eh, don't get me wrong, C-137. We're happy for your good fortune, but we did not travel to your universe just to have it rubbed in our faces."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"C'mon, Big Fat Rick, you know your face is too small to rub anything on."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,My face is the same size as yours.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Wow, huh. Hold on."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"I'll be damned. You're so fat, it's an optical illusion. Summer, give him the pitch."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,We're offering to help each of your families complete their full Gotrons.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,Gabaloccia!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Ricardo Montoya,...what?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,In exchange for some concessions.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Ricardo Montoya,Ever since I was a little boy in the slums I have dreamed of having a complete Gotron. But concessions? I hope you mean the kind from a counter. I hope she means ice cream!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,Gabalo-guccia!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"We'd like you to move your families to this universe and let me make some modifications to the Gotrons, in the interest of us all working together."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,Wanna know what I think?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Sure, Hothead Rick. Just don't unexpectedly fly off the handle."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,I think you guys got a lotta nerve actin' better than us! This is the family that made a giant incest baby! Had the government launch it into space! It's still floatin' around out there somewhere!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Are we ever gonna live that down?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,When I get a full Gotron it won't be by kissin' your ass! It'll be by takin' what's mine! Yours!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Hey, gross! No need."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,And you were driving a ferret?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,"We all are, moron! Gimme the key!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,"You'll regret this, you level-headed fuck!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Obviously, we predicted that might happen, which is why we have Yo-Yo Rick on standby."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Anybody got beef with Yo-Yo?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Ricardo Montoya,"Eh, I'm okay. I'm okay with that."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Big Fat Rick,"Good, that's good."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Some people think he's lame, but to me, he's lame in a cool way, because he owns it. Cool. That concludes business. Little Ricky Wrap-it-up?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,"Raise 'em up, boys! Opa!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"And so we helped our people find their ferrets. How they got 'em, not our problem."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"Then we got down to business. Here's how it worked. If a giant monster attacked our planet, y'all got the alert."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,We formed five Gotrons. And those Gotrons formed the Gogotron.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Smith family,"Go, Gogotron!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,I will never get sick of this!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"If you were a giant monster at that time in our universe, you never had a chance!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Yo-Yo Rick,Mine needs a weapon like a yo-yo. And a yo-yo on the chest. Are you listening to me? I need you to respect this partnership!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"I kept Rick removed from the ugly stuff. If you got in his way, I got you out of the way."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,And that made more room to move up.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,The head of my right arm.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Me, I ended up the left foot of the left foot, I guess because our robot didn't have an asshole."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"Well, it had one."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Bitch! When are you going to stop breaking my balls? You win, okay?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"We're not competing, Morty. And there's your answer. I could move you up if I could trust you to put family first."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,How is that putting family first?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Show me all the blueprints! Show me all the blueprints!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I agree, that's an issue. Big Fat Rick, his flask stays full, or your locker gets emptied, thanks."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"I know it feels good when he likes you, but that doesn't mean him liking you makes you good."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Solid babble, Morty, like a fortune cookie written by Borat."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Yeah, I'm not as smart as you, that's why I know you know what I mean."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"You mean if I really loved my family, I'd give control of it back to your jealous ass? Green Ferret 4 needs a wash and we're out of detergent."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,I just bought a box.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,And Grandpa snorted it because you make him feel fenced in.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Sum-sum!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Get two boxes.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"We evacuated one of the planets we saved and found a secret nightclub on it. A place no enemies could find us, unless you count my brother."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"I didn't even have my own ferret anymore. Summer made me somethin' called an ""Associate Security Chief"", whatever the hell that means."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Look at this guy. Ha-ha. And look at this guy. Look at this guy over here!  Meow-meow-meow, meow, meow-meow!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Oh, there she is, my baby princess, get up here. Stop the music!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"This is our queef  our queen. She saved my life, she set me free, we wouldn't have what we have without this crazy bitch. And she's got a special announcement.  Summer, tell 'em what we talked about."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Now? I don't think 
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Okay, I'll do it, goddamn."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"The new job did have some perks, like I got to be around the night Summer realized she was in over her head."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Yeah, okay. I've got 90 extra ferrets, which means I need 10 more, and then 4 of you get your own Gogotron, and 20% of you get a Gotron, 'cause we're all gonna have a fuckin' Gogogotron!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,He's very excited. Um...
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, I hate my family."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,You should. Get in.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"How's it going with your grandpa's compulsiveness? Is your sister still enabling it, huh?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Who are you people?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 2,"Let's just say, we're the rightful owners of these ferrets."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Then why were they scattered and buried across the universe?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"We mean, in a more general, cultural sense, ehh!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"What your grandpa did is called appropriation! Not cool, heugh!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Look, Morty. We've been watching. We know you're the one that knows what's best. Work with us from the inside. Help us take over this operation. We're literally designed for it, mm-hmm?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 2,"Nobody will know it was you, then you can get back to what's important."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Are those Boob Bucks?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Legal tender at every kiosk and ride, huh?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"I can't. Summer's treating me like shit, but, she's still my sister."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"That's really noble, Morty. If you were in our family, your loyalty would be rewarded. But you're not in our family, which means we can kill you."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, yeah?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"And sure enough, just when I stuck my neck out for the family, it got stomped on, anyway."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Rick!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,Mom! Dad!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,"Hothead Rick, baby!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Hothead Rick,Aaaugh! I set myself up for that! Aaugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,What the hell happened?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Hothead Rick.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,How did he get so close to us?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Morty was supposed to be security.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Morty!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"I stepped away, all right? But not to let that happen!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Morty! We're not attractive strangers next to you on a flight to Paris traveling alone to get over a breakup, so this is no time to be coy!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,Opa!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Little Ricky!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Little Ricky,"I'm all wrapped up, Summer. Ohh..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Guys, I know you don't trust me, but what have we become? Why are we doing this anymore?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Because it's fun, you little rat! Now go home and play video games while we clean up these bodies, or your mother and I will hire people to break your knees!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"This is $16,000 we got from the Deep State for stepping on that trailer park. It should be enough for school, lunch, and home repairs. Now I gotta turn my back on you."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,No!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"With Morty out of the way, things were looking up. But looks aren't everything."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,New Jerry,"Hi, Summer. Umm, my cockpit's not getting Wi-Fi..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Dad, you know that's not what I do around here."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,New Jerry,"Oh, I'm not your dad. I'm a version of him, and this is my first day here, I'm not sure what you do around here."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Then, fuck off."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,New Jerry,"Oh, fuck you."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Excuse me? I want your ID.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Mom. Are you Mom? Can you control your working Jerrys?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Working Beth,"Sweetie, we're all a little overwhelmed."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Good point. You're not a war-time mom, why don't you find your version of Dad and take a break, take a holiday?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I don't have time to wait for your confirmation, so let's just say, if you're here in 10 minutes, I'll have you removed."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,And then the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Couple of snags, but I know how to speed things up."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Remember how we talked about how the best thing we could do for the family is recruit from outside the family?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Yes, way ahead of you. Summer, I want you to meet Kendra."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"She's from a temp agency. She's got an entire workforce ready to go, and all of them have previous giant robot pilot experience. So, we'll be ready to go ahead of schedule."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Well, I don't know about that, but..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Well, Kendra knows, so."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,So...
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,You're here to break my legs?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"No, we're here to talk shit about your sister, because she just fired us."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,You're kidding.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Arrogant little bitch.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Should we clip her?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"No, she's not worth doing time."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,You wouldn't do time. You brought her into the world.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,So I can take her out. You thought that was an actual law? It's a joke mothers say. What kind of fucked-up world have you been living in?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Uh, one where your mother murdering you isn't a comedic premise?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Guys. There's a little adjustment period, but pretty soon you're gonna return to normal, and you're not gonna wanna kill Summer, you're not even gonna be mad at her."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Nah, fuck her. She's my enemy."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Should we kill ourselves so we can get to hell before her and hide near the entrance?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Hmm, I like that."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Rick fired me.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Aww, baby..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Aww, sweetie..."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,I'm sorry.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"Are you okay, baby? What happened to us? We lost our minds."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,I did it. Morty was right. I got addicted to making Grandpa happy.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,It's only because your grandpa inflates the value of his happiness.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Eh, that's a good point. I mean, look at me, I'm easy to make happy, which is why nobody gives a shit if I am."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I appreciate it, but there's something else, too. I've been really sensitive about family lately because of something I've been keeping secret."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Oh.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Okay, who's on the Supreme Court and what state do we live in, it's been years since I thought about this."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"No, I'm not pregnant, but as you guys recall, and as a lot of people keep bringing up, Morty and I did accidentally create a giant incest baby, which the government did launch into space. And, I'm not sure how to tell you this, but, it is still alive, and I have been in contact with it."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"There were soldiers waiting for me outside school last month, and they took me to the Pentagon and briefed me, and from there I was shuttled to a secret base on Mars. They had captured him and wanted to see if he'd respond to me. instinctively, being his mother. And he sure did, but what they didn't expect was that I'd respond to him. I was supposed to help discipline him so they could turn him into the ultimate weapon. Instead, I trained him to love, to believe in himself, and finally, to escape."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"The government doesn't want anyone to know it happened, but it's only a matter of time before the story comes out, and when it does, all we're going to have is each other, and you guys are a couple, and Rick has Morty, but I'm the odd one out, so I wanted to make sure we stuck together. But instead I drove us apart and Rick replaced me with an anime girl, so all I got is myself and my giant tortured government-trained rogue incest monster baby out there in space somewhere."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,"Aww, baby. Holy fuck. And then you have to wonder, what else are they doing with our taxes?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Wait, Summer, what did you just say?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Morty, a lot."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"He replaced you with an anime girl? Big eyes, plus signs for teeth, ends sentences with weird sounds that don't fit?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Yeah, and that's going to be his whole crew now, and they're about to run their first test on the Gogogotron."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Those people wanna steal the robot. They're gonna kill Rick! He's all alone, we've gotta go save him!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Right. Or, you know, fuck him."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,I'm good with that.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,Yep. Fuck him.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Guys! A great leader once told me, you get the family you get."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Right. It works. Now we just gotta find a giant monster.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"My sensors have picked one up, Rick."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Okay, okay. Lock onto its location."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Yeah, got it. Oh, it's you!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Huh?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,What the hell is this?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Thanks for making the biggest robot ever, Rick. We'll take it from here. Haha!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,You little assholes!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,Ah! You son of a bitch!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,No!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Deuugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Lock and load, boys."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Say hello to my little me.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,Deagh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Ha-ha-ha-ha!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick's gun,Bang-bang-bang-bang
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Yaugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"Give up, old man. The G3 is ours. And last I checked, your family wasn't coming to save you, hmm?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Incest Baby,"Ga-ga, goo-goo!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,Holy mother of mercy!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"My God, it's beautiful."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Yeah, family!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,Is that
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"It's exactly what it looks like, yes."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Anime Guy 1,"Congrats, man. I see the resemblance."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,Form the energy sword. Activate the goddamn sword!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Oh, man. The sword? Maybe we didn't think this through."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Beth,"They're not actually gonna attack a space baby, are they?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"I never thought I'd be the one to say this, but you need to watch more anime, Mom."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Whoa, easy now, Naruto."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Naruto,Momma go bye-bye.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Kendra,"What the hell is wrong with you people? You just have an incest space monster in your back pocket, huh?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Welcome to the Smith family.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,"Shit. Put that down, Naruto. Your great grandpa is in there."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,What do you say? One last zip line?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,"Heugh.  Incest space baby, nicely done."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"After that, things pretty much went back to normal. Some version of it, anyway."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Rick said Gotrons were lame little kid bullshit, and we never talked about 'em again."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,"Except all those gigantic space bugs were runnin' loose, and there were no Gotrons left to fight them."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Yeah, millions die every day."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer voiceover,You wanna know what they could never kill? Family.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Jerry,Help! Help! I'm still out here! Aaagh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"Yep, nothin's more important than "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty,"Hey! Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Summer,Eugh!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Morty voiceover,"And just like that, I knew our goose was as cooked as "
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Rick,Voiceovarians. Eugh.
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,"Somatski, you're late!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Somatski,Won't happen again! Sir!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,"Bugs! Look to your left. Now look to your right. None of you are coming back. Not one, in the entire history of this program, not a single bug has returned. All right, bring it in."
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,What are we?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Bugs,Normal-sized bugs!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,What do we do?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Bugs,Travel through an interdimensional gateway to planets and tiny people!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,Why do we do it?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Bugs,To spread the cure for AIDS!
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Palicki,"Hey, Sarge, how do we know if these little people can understand us? I mean, do they even speak Buginese?"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Sergeant,"Funny, Palicki. That's why we say it very loud. Guys, you'll still be the same civilized bug on their side. It's not like interdimensional travel strips us of our clothes and makes us screaming monsters. Or, maybe it does, impossible to know. Now get out of here!"
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Somatski,My clothes... Where'd they go?
5,Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion,Somatski,"OWW! Stop shooting me! Okay, here goes. ONE PART LEMON JUICE! FOUR BAY LEAVES! A PINCH OF SEA SALT!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Come on Rick, w-we're almost there."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,Leave me Morty. It's the only way.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,Wha-were-were we Blades in that one? That's fucking tight.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Just stay with me.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"I'm scared, Morty. I can see the end. I'm a silly man. I'm a small, silly man."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,I'm sorry I got you into this.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Then how about I get us out of this?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,Hello?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,I-It's Morty. From school.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Oh hey, Morty. What's up?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Um, I just want to say that you're really great and I'm sorry that the timing never really worked out with us, but you're really great and I wish I got to know you better."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Oh, I mean, that's a lot."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, I guess I just..."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"No, I just wish you'd said it sooner."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Wh-What?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Yeah, I mean being nervous is sort of selfish sometimes, you know?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Ship alarm,Life support systems failing.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Yeah, that's a great point."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Well, what are you doing tonight?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,Tonight?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Jessica,"Yeah, do you, like, want to watch a movie or something?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Um, yeah, tonight. Sounds great.  Holy shit! Holy shit! Come on, come on!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"Ugh, where are we?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"We're home, Rick. I landed us in the ocean."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,The ocean? The ocean on Earth?!
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Uh, yeah, I guess so."
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"Oh, shit. Holy shit. We have to go. We have to go right fucking now!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,What?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"You touched the ocean, Morty. Oh fuck! Shit!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Mr. Nimbus,Richard! You have desecrated the sacred treaty betwixt land and sea! Now face the wrath of your once and eternal foe... Mr. Nimbus!
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Sorry, who is that?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,My... nemesis.
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,What?
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,"My fucking nemesis, okay?!"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Morty,"Okay, but what was his name again?"
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Mr. Nimbus,I am Mr. Nimbus!
5,Mort Dinner Rick Andre,Rick,He's gonna say that a lot.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You two are hungry.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Big day.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,We're gonna kill God.
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Come again?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Christian God is real, he's been asleep for thousands of years. We're gonna sneak up there and kill him."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Mob style.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Whack his ass.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Can I kill God?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Fuck off, Summer."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Pfft, as if!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Beth, do you hear this?"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Sweetie, don't get all worked up before your job interview."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Job interview?
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Yes, is that so hard to believe?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Actually, yeah. Something's off."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,No!
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Shit!
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,"Hunt me, hunt me, somebody hunt me!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Don't hunt him to completion!
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,Hunt me!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh. Shit. Everyone start packing, no time to explain."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Rick?
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Dad? What's wrong?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Someone just killed a decoy family.
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,I'm Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,You made clones of us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Decoys, Morty. Very different.  Very different, sweetie."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Different h-ow!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Yeah, dad. Different h-ow?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie. I'm cool, and it makes them feel bad. So, y'know, after that trouble with Space Beth, I made passable copies of the family and placed them around the country as a buffer zone to protect"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,But why does he always want to be hunted?
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Jerry
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"It's not important right now, dad!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family and place them all around the country, but fuck me if I have questions about the starfish man in a target suit."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,So thankful this is my Saturday.
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Why was he in that cryopod?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"The cryopod is what confuses you? Jerry, can't you see we've moved on to higher stakes?"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Well, I don't see any stakes at all."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Ah, shit!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Guess we'll just be saying ""ciao bella"" to our deposit, then!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Shut up and pack, Jerry. Squids just killed a decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Decoy family?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Is this why you wanted to get out of town?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You think I'd lie to you about why we're on vacation, Morty? I wouldn't lie to you.  Well, that's a lie. Huh."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,So someone out there is trying to kill us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Someone's always trying to kill us. That's what the decoys are for. They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures, and take bullets meant for us. Shit."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Ahhh! No!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Ah, shit. Decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I think dad was still outside. What's a decoy family?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Hard concept, Morty. Hard concept. I've never really cracked it, if I'm being honest. Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead for another special episode!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Oh, cool!"
5,Mortyplicity,TV,We now return to When Wolf.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Woah, a time traveling wolf? Count me in."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Yeah, I never thought of the ""were"" in ""werewolf"" like ""who, what, when and where!"" Clever wordplay!"
5,Mortyplicity,Dracula,When Wolf!
5,Mortyplicity,When Wolf,Dracula! You know why I'm here.
5,Mortyplicity,Dracula,"I'm safe here, Ian! Christianity hasn't been invented yet, crosses are just baby t's to me now! I got out. Please, don't invite me back in."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You're right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept. I'd much rather watch When Wolf go to the 20's and invest in the stock market, but then eat people."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Yeah.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Look, if you really want to know what happened to Beth's mom, it whoop. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Decoy family? You made more clones?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Clones are, like, thirty-two percent of all sci-fi, sweetie. You don't get to own clones. Yes, I made some decoys. They're exactly like us, with a few tweaks and a backdoor shutdown."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Do you just get hard creating sentient life?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Actually, I get hard protecting my family!"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Ew.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Ugh, gross!"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Yeah, now everyone gets killer doppelg ngers. Cool deal."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"The decoys are harmless, Beth."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they're decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"They wouldn't be very good decoys if they did, Sum-sum."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,So they think they're us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,That's the deal.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"How do you know we're not decoys?  Oh my god, we're decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh, god! We might not be real! We might be decoys! Morty, quick!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,What do I do?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"My failsafe, Morty. My final, secret failsafe. It proves I'm real, you have to help me, I'd never joke about this.  There's a barcode, Morty. A barcode on the interior of my left ass cheek."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,What?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Morty, please, I'm begging you!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I'm not looking at your ass!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Please, Morty, is it there? God damn it!  Just tell me if I'm real!"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Morty, do it!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Gross!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Dad!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Summer, you fucking idiot. We're not decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Why did I get punished?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"A, decoys don't build decoys, and B, you think the mere suggestion I'm fake would break me? Christ, I'm not your mom."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Fuck off.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Jeez, these guys really wanna kill me bad. Alright, here's the plan. We're gonna hide out with a decoy family, and when these squids show up, we jump their asses. Jerry! Come on! Family emergency!"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting? They're gluten free, sugar free, and lemon free!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Think you got the wrong house, bro."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8-0-0-8-5."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Kind of expected a funnier password.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I didn't plan on showing them off.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Damn, like Westworld!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Yes, Morty, like Westworld. But don't fuck them.  Summer!"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Whatever, creep. I'm gonna see how accurate you got my room."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, did you mean like, you know, an exact replica?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"I know about the Yosemite t-shirt, Morty."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Shit.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You know you can use tissues, right?"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I can't finish without it.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,So you do know what a happy family looks like.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I know what a fake one looks like.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Uh, Rick?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,What?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Did you use this house to make decoys, too?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"What? Morty, why the fuck would I do that? You think I'd go somewhere else to  okay, well, I am now less worried about the squids.  Isolate head at normal processing.  What the fuck do you think you're doing down there? You're making decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Wait, how do youoh god, Summer was right."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Everyone in the car.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You said decoys didn't make decoys.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"And usually, they don't, but again, it's nothing to worry about, because decoys are harmless.  Just have to, y'know, visit the rest and terminate the program."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Terminate? They're alive, dad!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"And at some point, they won't be. That's how existing works. What, are you going to save every stray cat?"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"No, but I can resist making more of them in a lab."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Ugh. Look, save the empathy. It's more termite infestation than Blade Runner."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,I still think we're decoys.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,You just want an excuse to stop trying.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Yeah, and?"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Oooh, there's a handsome fellow!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Uh-oh.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,I thought you made them harmless.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I don't remember making this one.
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,"Oh, hi, Rick! Family...me...? Hey, when did you all leave?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Analysis mode, 8-0-0-8-5."
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,Hmm?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Nothing, buddy. You gotta stop with all that coffee, it's making you loopy! Happy analysis mode!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,"Happy analysis mode to you, too!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Think you got the wrong house, bro."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8-0-0"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Shit, you think I'm a decoy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,How do you know about the decoys?
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,They were my idea!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,"Well, now I know you're pranking me."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Analysis mode, password 8 equals sign equals sign capital ""d""."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Hide.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,What?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Hide!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,"Wow, like Ex Machina!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Yes, Morty, like Ex Machina. But don't fuck them. Summer!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"Whatever, weirdo. I'm gonna see how wrong you got my room."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,So you do know what a loving family looks like.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"A simulated one, yes."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Why are we hiding?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"He thinks he's me, and I was about to start terminating decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,But we're not decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Sure, tell him that."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,"Rick, did you make decoys here, too?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Morty, for what reason could I have for...what the isolate head at normal processing!  You dumb asshole, you made decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Again, they were my idea. Wait, what happened to the other guy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Other guy?
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,"Wait, that means I'm a decoy. Fucking Summer."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Check the closets.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,They've gone rogue!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Killer decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Take out the decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,Shit! Someone put a gun in my teeth!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"Stop shooting, dad! They're us, we don't have to fight them!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Classic prisoner's dilemma, Beth. I'm a cool guy, I, you know, I can talk it out. But that asshole"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Me? You decoy piece of shit. You're the one that shot first!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"We can work this out, just stop trying to kill each other!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Sorry, decoy Beth, but this only ends one way, with one of us accepting we're a decoy."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"And once he knows he's a decoy, he know he won't be safe until he's killed the real Rick, along with anyone who think he's him."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Pretty perceptive, for a decoy."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,This is getting nowhere. Let's charge their asses on three.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Do we have to do this?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Morty, this is gonna sound bad, but...would you trust me not to kill you?"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Oof.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"I mean, good point, but Jesus Christ."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,We rush them on three. Ready?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,"I don't want to kill us, Rick!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"It's them or us, Morty. I don't trust me. Do you trust you?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,Yes?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Freak.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Before you say anything, they were already killing each other."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Well, you could've done something."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Not sure, actually. I've heard stories about this. We're looking at a possible Asimov Cascade."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Sorry, what's happening?"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"I need an explainer, too."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Yeah, I'm pretty much behind on this one."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Car, can I get a whiteboard?  When squids started killing decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they're making decoys. That's making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they're decoys, making them start to kill other decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Say decoy again.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Fuck you.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Well, how do we stop it?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Beth, the loop's already started. It's basically Highlander rules now.  Really? 1986? ""There can be only one?"" Shit, we gotta rent it after this. Connery plays ""the spaniard"" but does nothing about his accent."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this, would killing them finish it?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Might work. Alt pitch, we just terminate the rest of the decoys."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Nobody's terminating anything. This is your mess, nobody else with our face and memories has to die."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don't know how many decoys there are. You get far enough down the decoy line and shit starts to get weird. You ever make a copy of a copy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You're helping us fix this. We're taking out the squids.
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"I say we split up! Some of us take down squids, while the rest of us"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Engage in B stories we'll have to track simultaneously? No thank you! We stick together till this is all wrapped up.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"I dunno, the squids seem pretty good at taking out Smith families."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Well, this'll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,This costume smells like ass!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"God, there's no pleasing you!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"It's really bad, Rick."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Did you let a gym coach break it in?
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Why are we wearing these?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Because we'll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Which we won't.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Unless we're decoys. He's starting to wonder! I knew it. I knew we didn't seem like Colorado people.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Oh my god! You are, aren't you? You're worried you might be fake!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Sure, Beth. Try to love this more."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Just glad you have to walk a mile in someone else's squid costumes.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"There's one.  Hey, what're they mad at you for, anyway?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Well, we're talking about me. It could be anything. Maybe jealous of my penis size, I had sex with their queen, my dick's too big, the list goes on and on."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Alright, hey, one down! Probably, what, forty more to go? Forty-five? Should be pretty easy, unless killing them brings in a bigger bad or some kind of horrible mothership. Okay, let's loot their ship, find their weaknesses, be done by sundown."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Huh.
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Wait, but if the squids are decoys and we dressed as squids..."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Well, I found their weakness. They don't fucking listen to me!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Honestly, probably for the best."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Man, I'm good."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Dad!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh, shit. One of mine."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Where are we going?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Off grid, Morty. We're gonna live in the woods, like libertarians. We'll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar that we cut off with a knife."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,That licks.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"We might be decoys, Summer. Everything about this licks."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Oh, maybe now you'll empathize with the decoys you're killing!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Wait, shhh. It's too quiet."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,You skipped quiet.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,I didn't skip shit. It's obviously quiet if it's too quiet.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Yeah, but you're supposed to say"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You know what, Summer, now it's not quiet enough!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Where are we? Where's Rick?
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"He's right here, Morty!  Oh, are we not happy to see grandpa? Does he look...different?"
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,"Oh, god!"
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"Ugh, it stinks!"
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"Yes, recoil at the craftsmanship. I could tell I was a fake from the day I was born. Unlike you. Unlike them."
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"You see, Ricks, they get lazy. There's always a shitty decoy towards the end. But those decoys made decoys too, and got lazy themselves. And far enough down the line...there be monsters."
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Ugh, we get it, you're ugly and mad about it."
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,Rick!
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Grandpa!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Kill me... if I ever get this arch.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"Hush, little decoy. Can't kill you yet. The skin needs to be fresh."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You know what? You're a monster.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"I'm your father! At least, I can look more like him once I harvest all this yummy skin."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,This guy's really into skin.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,It's not all for me. A Rick provides for his family.
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Beth,"Will I beautiful again, daddy?"
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,"Soon, baby. Beautiful again soon."
5,Mortyplicity,Scarecrow Rick,What the
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Rick,Help the others!
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Why are you helping us?
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Rick,Because we're all in this together. Come on! There's a place we can go!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Hey, who needs all this war stuff? I found a can of varnish. This is a ticket to the world beyond the river!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Summer,Who wants that? I crave glorious death in decoy battle!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Morty,"Also, y'know, depending on the varnish, might look like blackface."
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Excuse me for wanting to live.
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,"Brothers and sisters, welcome to the cause. To our cause. We are no longer Ricks and Mortys, Beths and Jerrys, or also Summers."
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Summer,Whatever.
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Summer,Asshole!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,"We are decoys. Brought into the world by an unloving god, and drive to destroy ourselves by the uncertainty he creates!"
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,I don't know if that's accurate.
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Rick,Sounds extreme.
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,But that violence ends today!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Jerry,What about the squids?
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Beth,The squids are decoys!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Summer,There were no squids!
5,Mortyplicity,Other Decoy Summer,The squids are decoys who realized they're decoys and wanted to kill the other decoys.
5,Mortyplicity,Other Decoy Jerry,"Yeah, it is a lot."
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Beth,We cannot let confusion divide us!
5,Mortyplicity,Decoy Morty,"Squids! Squids, of course, being shorthand for killer decoys!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Rick,"Inner sanctum, the escape tunnel!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"I'm sorry, I didn't ask for this! I just wanna live! But there's only so much varnish! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,How long before the other decoys find us?
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Sooner or later. Can't really run from it. Any place we'd think to hide is a place they'd think to look. It's Rule 34 of an Asimov Cascade.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,I'm just glad we're living to the fullest with the time we have left.
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,"Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item. Who's next?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Jerry? Bucket list?
5,Mortyplicity,Jerry,I'd like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Nope! Morty?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico school.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Shit. Sorry, buddy. Sounds like it would've been real heartwarming."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,They looked happy. Did we have to kill them?
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"Well, maybe their Rick came to grips with his bullshit!"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"You're so mean today! I'm your dad, you like having me around!"
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,You keep putting us in danger!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Whatever. This'll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?"
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"House, I need something quick. Can you whip up a Star Fox boss season four callback? Make it flashy?"
5,Mortyplicity,House,"You got it, babe."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Let's go, you little bitch.  It's showtime.  Get centered."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"What up, you decoy motherfuckers? Come on down to Rick's house of squids, where I'm serving your ass on a platter!  I know what you're thinking: ""Fuck, a beacon! That's a great idea! He's got home turf,  a tacit psychological advantage, and absolutely pendulous balls!""  And now you're thinking ""shit, that's totally what the rick-est Rick would do! I might actually be fake!  I pretended I didn't care if I was, but I totally did! Now the only way to prove I'm real and not him is to ice his expository ass.""  Yup. So let's do it. Come get some. What? No, Morty, I'm gonna loop it. Why is it"
5,Mortyplicity,Steve,"Sir, there seems to be a confluence of Rick Sanchezes killing each other over the American Southwest."
5,Mortyplicity,The President,"Sounds exhausting. How many of those states voted for me, anyway?"
5,Mortyplicity,Steve,"Mr. President, I think the point of the electoral collage is"
5,Mortyplicity,The President,"To preserve slavery? That's right, Steve. I have the internet too. Now take your white ass to the kitchenette and bring me a Diet Coke."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Little out of character to say this right now, but you guys look really cool."
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,"We might be decoys, huh."
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,One way to find out.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Looks like it's calming down. You wanna get in one more ""I told you so"" about synthetic life or whatever this week's theme is?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"Oh, fuck you."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Whoa.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"No, you don't get to be annoyed with this! You treat life and family as so burdensome, and yet you created an ocean of us because you're terrified of losing either!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Shit.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,Yeah.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Look, Beth, I might not be the real Rick. But even if I'm not, he made me, or the me that made me. Which means somewhere inside of him is a version of Rick capable of hearing that. A version of Rick who's sorry. I'm sorry about the clone thing, too. I love you."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,"Thanks, dad.I love you, too. You really think we're decoys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Eh. Who cares? We'll be the last ones left. Lucky that one did the beacon, this was gonna take weeks.  Alright, let's mop up."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Beth,Finally.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Dressing as decoys too cute to murder. You know, I'm not sure it helped, but I'm glad we tried it."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Morty,We're losing the costumes?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"Thank god, this decoy outfit smells like ass."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Fuck you, Summer."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Shit, that guy's awesome. Okay, listen, he might actually be the real Rick. But whatever happens"
5,Mortyplicity,Summer,Wait! We don't have to do this. We're both Summers. Shouldn't we at least try molly before we die?
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"You know what, yeah. Fuck this noise."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"Wait, I don't know who to shoot."
5,Mortyplicity,Both Mortys,Summer!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,"I can't deal with this. I had to kill myself. You have too, to."
5,Mortyplicity,Both Mortys,Summer!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Fuck you, I'm real! I'm the smartest man in the universe!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Probably not even wrong. But that's just it. I'm not a man. I'm God!
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,You're just made in my image.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,Fuck you.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"You the, uh, Summer I came with?"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Summer,Probably.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,Good enough. Morty?
5,Mortyplicity,Morty,Yeah.
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,"I'm here, too."
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Holy shit, that was insane! I love you guys, I've totally changed!"
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"Oh, fuck."
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,You shoulda hunted me.
5,Mortyplicity,Second Rick,"What? Whowere you significant? Like, did we tee you up? You want to be hunted? God, I have so many questions. Why? What happens if"
5,Mortyplicity,Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted,Somebody hunt me!
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Pretty cool adventure, huh? Big, long road trip adventure through space? Even ran into Space Beth. Maybe that'll happen more often!"
5,Mortyplicity,Space Beth,Let's not overdo it.
5,Mortyplicity,Rick,"Oh, shit. Looks like someone killed the decoy family."
5,Mortyplicity,Beth,Decoy family?
5,Mortyplicity,Space Beth,Decoy what now?
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Hello?
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Oh, oh my god! Oh my god!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"No! No, no no, no no no no no!"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Nooooo!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Oh god. Yes, yes, sweet death."
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Why am I still alive? Oh, god. Is there anything left? Hello?"
5,Mortyplicity,Woodpecker,What is it?
5,Mortyplicity,Dolphin,A relic...from a kinder past.
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Wait, cowboys?"
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,Christianity again ?After cowboys? You went all the way back around?!
5,Mortyplicity,Glockenspiel Jerry,"Oh god, why can't I die? This is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,Are we - are we gonna put it back when we're done with it?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Why? The only thing of value on it is the secret treasure map. The rest is just instructions for running a country, and I'm pretty sure they're online."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,It just feels a little wrong -
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Morty, are you gonna be a fucking American nerd or are you gonna be cool and steal the constitution with Grandpa? Here, hold this while I crack the hermetic seal."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,W-Why not just use this again?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Morty! You just destroyed the map and activated the giant assassin hidden in the Statue of Liberty!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,"I'm sorry - W-wait, what?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"It was a Trojan horse, Morty. Never trust the French. Alright, fun's fun, but now the federal government's gonna be pissed again. Way to go. And on America's birthday or whatever the fuck Thanksgiving is."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Soldier,Rick and Morty! You are under arrest and surrounded by an anti-portal shimmer! Come out with your hands up!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,"Well, happy Thanksgiving to me. Can't wait to see what a ""shimmer"" does to my prostate."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Beth,"Dad, can you just end whatever this is -"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"I understand you're upset Mr. President. It's honestly all Morty's fault. But in the meantime, you really want to keep your army of pointlessly camouflaged Eagle Scouts off my lawn."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Don't tell me what I want you anti-American piece of shit! You terrorist!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"You know, you use that word so much it's lost all meaning, Mr. P. It's like, at this point, what's a terrorist? It's a guy you don't like. Big deal."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Told you to stand down. You just lost two soldiers over here. Good men. Might be time to look at the terrorist in the mirror.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"You want a war?! I'll put your outer-space ass in a goddamn Phantom Zone with a bar of kryptonite soap around your neck. You're done, Sanchez! You hear me?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Oof. He's really pissed this time.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Summer,Why don't you guys just fuck and get it over with.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Okay, well thank you, Summer, but I think I've got a better option."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Beth,"Dad, no."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"Ehh, hands are tied, sweetie. I have to turn myself into a turkey and trick the President into giving me a Presidential turkey pardon."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,Again? How many times have you done this?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"I don't know, Jerry, how many years have I lived here? Careful how you answer that."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Morty,"Geez, Rick, y'know, y-you've done this a lot. Don't you think the President might see it coming this time?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,"He probably will, Morty. That's all part of the dance. In the past, I've inserted myself into the potential turkey pardonee population by brainwashing the presidential turkey wrangler prior to the ceremony."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"But this time, the turkey wrangler's been euthanized and the turkeys will be transported by armored military vehicles."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Vehicles manufactured by ghost corporations that I control.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Which we have audited.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Allowing me access to...
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Central computer...
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,To track the...
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Real armored transports, which he can never..."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Totally track and sneak aboard.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"And even if he does, he'll be on a truck full of turkeys and fully armed marines."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Rick,Who won't recognize me because the human eye is inherently face blind to turkeys.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Fortunately, those marines won't have human eyes. They'll have turkey eyes."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Dwayne,"Jesus ever-loving Christ, why don't you two just fuck and get it over with?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Careful, Dwayne. You're only Vice President because I need 10% of the white vote."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Dwayne,"There's a giant French assassin attacking New York, and you're using the war room to measure dicks with your alcoholic sci-fi boyfriend?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"Rick Sanchez is more dangerous than some steam-powered French bitch, and New York can handle its own global emergencies. General? Initiate Operation Deep Gobble."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,"Coop, not on Thanksgiving."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Coop,"It's what I trained for, Mary Lou."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,It ain't our fight.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Coop,Baby. That little race car driver you got bakin' in your belly. What world would you want him rearin' up in? One where some... spiky-haired Doctor Who in a lab coat can change the color of the sky? Or a world where he can fill his pickup with hot dogs and drive it to a jukebox full of our demographic's current favorite music?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,"Obviously the latter, but --"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Coop,"Well, that world, Mary Lou, the one with those meals, vehicles and songs people in this 30-mile area prefer... that world needs a few good men. In a secret Pentagon lab. Turning into turkeys."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mary Lou,"You come back without feathers, Coop."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Marvin,"God, I love this country."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,These pills contain tracking chips that identify each of you as individuals. That will be important later.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Alright, boys, search every bird. If Sanchez is here, I wanna hear you gobblin'."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 2,"Let me look at you, scum. get outta here, you wobbleneck."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 3,"Sarge, this -- this ain't like the simulation, man. I don't like it."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Keep it together, Martinez. Eyes are on the ground, sir. No sign of Einstein."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mr President,"Stay frosty, gentlemen. I want this pardoning pipeline airtight."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Soldier,Sir! We have hacked the garage door. We are in. Eyes on the bogey.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Mr President,Or you've got eyes on a robot.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Soldier,"All due respect, sir, I know flesh when I see it!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Rick,"Those flesh-covered  robots should buy us some time. The pardonable turkeys should be on that truck. Ship, go stealth."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Rodriguez, Fincher. Get eyes on that."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Rick,Huh. Turkey Marines. The President came to play. Jam those two radios.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Ship,Confirmed.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,"Fincher, Rodriguez, come in!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Rick,"Copy, copy, tango, all good. Just a couple of branches on the roof."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Turkeyfied Marine 1,Don't ever turn your radio off again.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Flesh Rick/Morty,We will not/never surrender.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,Oh yeah? Bring in the David Blaine box.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Summer,"Damn, is that a David Blaine box?"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,I told you we should have just gone to my parents' house.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Beth,"No, you didn't."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Jerry,"Well, I didn't say it out loud, but it should be well known by now that I'd always rather be there."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Flesh Rick,"Oh, God, oh no!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Flesh Morty,"Aw, geez, Rick!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,"Sir, we've got Rick and Morty inside the box!"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Then that confirms it.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,Sir?
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,No David Blaine box can hold Rick Sanchez. Scan the turkey truck!
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Marine,Huh. That's weird. ID chips for Fincher and Rodriguez are glitching.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,Sanchez... I'll deal with this bastard myself.
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,General,"Sir, don't be a cowboy. You can't get re-elected dead."
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,Scientist,"System is calibrated, sir. That pill contains a tracking chip that will identify --"
5,Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular,The President,"I know, it'll be important later! Do it."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Alien Woman,It's the Crow Man!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #1,Give it a second. Maybe he's taking it out to surrender.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Alien Man,He's anti-heroic. Run!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #2,I don't understand!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #3,He's only one man!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,With the power of a thousand crows.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #3,Good luck.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Owl #2,"Crows and owls have always been at war, but why do you care?! What's the point?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Here's two.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Haha, yeah, cool."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Morty?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"H-hey man. G-good to see you.  Y-you're like, looking like, into crows. Still."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Oh, uh, Two Crows, you remember Morty. Morty, Two Crows. It's good to see you, but give me more of a heads-up."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood. I-it wasn't like
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,It's just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That came out wrong. S-sounded judgey."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crow Horse,Crow Horse. Crow Horse. Crow Horse.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Okay. It looks like it looks like they're leading you to a thing.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Take care, Morty."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"You-you too. U-uh I'm doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Ahem. I'm lookin' for Crowscare. The scarecrow? The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Rick!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Morty?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Pussifer,Wood 
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Th-that's how long it's been, Rick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Do you have a rum and Coke?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Waiter,"What are you, twenty?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Time be goin' by, don't she?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,That's your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I feel okay.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Well-well, what about me?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Woah. Excuse us boys, you don't wanna be here for this."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"I thought if I gave you enough space, you'd outgrow this phase."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Waiter,"Here's your drink, poser."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Dad got sick, you know. Stage Four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer's a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, what we had wasn't healthy."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their big bad?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"First off, the ""will-they kill-they"" is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I hope that's not true, Morty. Because you look like sh--shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Now that I have his two crows, nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Don't defend him to me, I don't even get what you see in him."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"You're right, we should be enjoying the time we have together."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Crow Rick! Oh, I know what this must look like but"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Looks like my arch-nemesis Crow Scare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,You are hardly the victim here. I was adventuring with these two crows before you ever came along.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"What do you mean, ""using me as a rebound""?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could've been worse. At least ""adventuring"" was just a metaphor for romantic partnership, so it's not a real breakup."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other's bodies.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"What?! Eugh, no!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crowscare,"Sounds like the man's asking for proof! Let's show him, fellas!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I-I asked for zero proof. Zero proof!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I'm giving you free will. Yah!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Crow Horse,Submit to Crow Horse!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Whoops.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,R-Rick?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wubba lubba dub dub! I'm back, pal!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Jerry,"Morty, who's at the door?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-What the hell's going on here?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"See, um, th-the thing is, uh"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Beth,"Can you please make Morty fourteen again, Dad? This is ridiculous."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Okay, look, I-I may have used an Aging Serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I'm done with the Two Crows; like, they were super clingy, and I'm ready to make this work."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Let's just hit the Reset Button.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Beth,"Well no, honey, not a reset. Okay? Tell your grandpa that you're worthy of his respect and you wanna be treated differently from now on."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"I refuse to do that, I'm desperate to get back together."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Jerry,Just like his old man.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Don't worry honey, that's just Morty's middle-age talking. He'll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Summer,"Uh, I'd like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Summer,I'd rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Just like you! I-I got it from The Citadel.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See ya later, masturbators!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Andy,"Hi! I'm the Citadel's new mascot, Andy. Because this place wouldn't be home without Ricks Andy Morties!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Dumb.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Oof. What happened to this place?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,There's a Morty president now.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Ah, that's cute. They rebuilt. They made it nicer."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,They made it Glendale.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Goddamn, you are cantankerous."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Even pooping hurts now.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Okay, so we've got a standard Morty that's been aged to... forty?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Can you reverse it?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Well if you look at it like a bone, what we can do is break his age in two places, remove the middle, and graft its ends back together."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Th-th-that sounds really violent.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"It's not a literal bone, Morty."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Oh, okay."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Brace yourself, the process does also break every bone in your body."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Wait!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Aaaah!!! Ooh, ow!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Toddler Morty #1,I like crayons.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Toddler Morty #2,Girls are gross.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I-I-I think I feel like myself again!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin's all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Probably. Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the twenty-six years we removed."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wait, what? I ain't payin' to store twenty-six years!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Employee Morty,"Well, then you're taking it with you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,I'm almost ready to sell out.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Alright, what's disposal cost?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,S-something unfair's happening!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Deformed Morty,There's no escape. No escape!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,Let me help you. This is not a good look!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Oh boy.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Hey, they shot me!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Police Morty #2,You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Deformed Morty,Listen to me!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Police Morty #2,Drop the gun!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Deformed Morty,Death is coming for us all! And the Citadel is a weapon of mass destru--!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Woof. You're about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let's get out of here before this gets political."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,U-uh... was I... influential?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven seven blogs."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Adult Morty,Tight.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Ugh. Too late.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Secret Service Rick,Rick C-137. President Morty requests you join him for dinner.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Whoa! S-seriously?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,You know I destroyed this place.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Secret Service Rick,"You've been pardoned for that, sir."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Rick, let's have dinner with the Morty president."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on Canon."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Okay! I guess things really are going right back to how they were.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Fine! I could eat. But the second he reveals he's evil, we're gone."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I don't know. Tastes pretty good.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Okay, let me know if you start feeling poison-y. Good to have you back, buddy."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Sorry I'm late. Never really ends around here.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Look at this, Morty. They really did make a you the president."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"And I hate em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that's a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Haha."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Ha! Not unless you try to keep me here.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Ah geez, wouldn't dream of it. But it's amazing you dropped by, because I was eventually gonna hunt you down."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,There's the reveal! Let's dance.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Ha! Geez.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Morties. He's being really nice."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,All politicians are nice.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"He's a hot bag of peanuts, isn't he?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"We've been through a lot, a-and he does not like"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Serialized drama.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Wait, what?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"And now you're running it squeaky clean, right? That's why you got deformed Morties comin' up through the sewer lines talking about ""hope"" and ""change""?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Fair enough.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Good clap-back, Rick. What's the deal with that, Mr. P?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Alright, time to go, Morty."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I wanna know what he's talking about.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Yeah, you've come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Literally ten? Because now it would be six.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Oh, I'm fine with that. Make it two one."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Like I said, would've been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,You can't scan an entire brain over appetizers.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,You probably don't remember.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick Stan Lee,"Check out Season One, Episode Nine, Rickheads. Excel--cior!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Evil Rick!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,We kicked his ass!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"""Evil Rick!"" I love it. Smartest man in the universe. With an ego so big, you could just grab it like a joystick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Looks complete. I was afraid I'd have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I'm sorry, Rick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth a screwdriver.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I'd hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can't help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,You already know rogue Ricks used Morties to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"And I'm sure you don't know how far they've gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"There aren't infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He's an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he's attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we're with him. This is why we're alive."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"What... the fuck?! Rick, say this isn't true!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,It isn't the whole truth.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty/President Morty,Liar!/Liar.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,It's complicated!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,I'm not busy.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I'm basically Inspector Gadget."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Uh-oh.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"It's okay, he's free to go. He's the Rickest Rick. We'll never see him again."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, when you came here for that serum, did you refill this gun?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Yeah.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Holy shit!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I only know one man that ever hacked my portal gun, and it turned out it was evil you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President/Evil Morty,Yay! He's all caught up.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Wait! Hold it, hold it!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Wh-who's that?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Time for Big Boy. Duck!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Does he like it?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"He's a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Yoink!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President/Evil Morty,"You can't outrun your past, Rick."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Tch. Did you think my force field would be down the second time?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,"Ahaha! Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Loudspeaker System,"Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay..."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick D-716,"In uncertain times like these, I think it's important for me to say ""eat shit, fuck you!"" The drug companies paid for me to say every word, I have millions of dollars, and I don't care"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick D-716,"Oh, God! Oh fuck, no! Whoa--"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick D-716,And I'd just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"What's happening, Rick?!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"He hacked the entire city's portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here: out the bottom."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,What do you think he needed from your brain?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"I assume schematics for the Citadel's dimensional drive. If he's gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,What is the Central Finite Curve?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Q&A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Or not.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Can't you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We're back to simple adventures."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,It's not a new leaf until you tell me everything!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, we really don't have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"No, I-I don't trust you. I-I-I don't wanna do this anymore if I'm not gonna get straight answers from you."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"God damm it!  Here's my fucking downloaded brain, Morty. You wanna jump the shark? You wanna know my stupid crybaby backstory? Knock yourself out."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,No-not now!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Whoa. Dead wife?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"Of course that's the case. In their minds, they're the underdog."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,And that's how they justify this.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Morty, I'm not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it's part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they're all victims of themselves.  ""Oh, it's so hard to be a genius!"" Couldn't you just die?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Well what are you doin' about it?
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"Jack shit. I'm leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around Infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he's the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"And I'm leaving it. That's what makes me evil', being sick of him. If you've ever been sick of him, you've been evil too."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Evil Morty,"There you go, kid! Now you're Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Orange Afro Rick,"Don't worry, Morty. We still got a way out they never thought of. Operation Phoenix."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Orange Afro Morty,"Doesn't that still mean, like, death?!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Orange Afro Rick,"Sure, but the joke's on them cuz we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Female computer voice,Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Female computer voice,Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Oh my fucking God!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Come on Morty, we gotta go!"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,Woah!
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,You can come if you want.
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,Don't blame me if you don't.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that's the best deal on the table. I-I don't have a real plan."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Thanks, pal. I-I'm glad you ignored my advice."
5,Rickmurai Jack,President Morty,It's just as well. I lied. That second seat's a toilet.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Morty,"Oh, super dick move! But weirdly kind of cool to admit it."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let's go."
5,Rickmurai Jack,They all get on a train and head for a different part of the Citadel,"Mortyburg. Rick, Morty, and all the other Mortys on the train disembark.)"
5,Rickmurai Jack,Rick,"Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Woo-wee! Evil Morty! That was quite a scheme. Makes me wonder if there's an evil me out there. But I guess, sometimes I look at my life, and I may not even need im. Cause, well, guess I made a pretty big mess of things myself. Ooo-eee."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"I never got my job at the university back. Remember that? Rick made me do karate. It was kinda funny, but I guess things went downhill from there."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,Started isolating myself from Amy. Used to tell her everything I was feeling.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,But then I guess I stopped.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Because I wanted her to love who she thought I was, not who I felt myself becoming."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,"Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be if they found out who we truly are? So we just dig ourselves deeper, into our lies every day,  ultimately only hurting the people who were brave enough to love us."
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,Wish I didn't do that!
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,Wish I was brave enough to love them back. I don't know. Maybe you should try it.
5,Rickmurai Jack,Mr. Poopybutthole,We don't have as much time as we think. Ooo eee.
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Beth,No parties. There's wafer cookies in the cupboard and I left emergency numbers on the fridge.
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,"Yeah, yeah. Wait what? Emergency numbers on the fridge; what does that even mean?"
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Beth,"Honestly, I don't even know. There's so many movies that start with the parents leaving- it just popped right out of my mouth. Are you sure you don't wanna come with us?"
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,"Naw, go- get outta here. I've got a million things I've been putting off."
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Morty,Are you sure Rick? I know- I know a cruise doesn't sound like an adventure on paper but what does? I- It's paper!
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,"Morty, I'm trying to stay humble right now, but as soon as you guys are gone the potential for a new Pickle Rick starts skyrocketing. Peace. Bye."
5,Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort,Rick,Bye!
